<h2 id="pgepubid00002">PREFACE TO THIS EDITION</h2>
</div>
<p>Has a novelist a right to alter his novel after its publication, to
condense it, to add to it, to modify or to heighten its situations, and
otherwise so to change it that to all outward appearance it is
practically a new book? I leave this point in literary ethics to the
consideration of those whose business it is to discuss such questions,
and content myself with telling the reader the history of the present
story.</p><p>一位小說家是否有權在其作品出版後修改其小說，將其壓縮，增加內容，修改或提高其情境，並對其進行如此改變，以至於從外觀上看，它實際上是一本新書？ 我將這個文學道德的問題留給那些需要討論這種問題的人考慮，並滿足於向讀者講述目前故事的歷史。</p>
<p>About ten years ago I went to Russia with some idea (afterwards
abandoned) of writing a book that should deal with the racial struggle
which culminated in the eviction of the Jews from the holy cities of
that country, and the scenes of tyrannical administration which I
witnessed there made a painful and lasting impression on my mind. The
sights of the day often followed me through the night, and after a more
than usually terrible revelation of official cruelty, I had a dream of a
Jewish woman who was induced to denounce her husband to the Russian
police under a promise that they would spare his life, which they said
he had forfeited as the leader of a revolutionary movement. The husband
came to know who his betrayer had been, and he cursed his wife as his
worst enemy. She pleaded on her knees that fear for his safety had been
the only motive for her conduct, and he cursed her again. His cause was
lost, his hopes were dead, his people were in despair, because the one
being whom heaven had given him for his support had delivered him up to
his enemies out of the weakness of her womanly love. I awoke in the
morning with a vivid memory of this new version of the old story of
Samson and Delilah, and on my return to England I wrote the draft of a
play with the incident of husband and wife as the central situation.</p><p>大約十年前，我曾帶著一種想法（後來放棄了）去過俄羅斯，打算寫一本書來描述導致猶太人被驅逐出該國的聖城的種族鬥爭，以及我在那裡見證的專制統治的場景。我在那裡所見到的畫面對我心裡造成了痛苦而持久的印象。白天見過的景象常常跟隨我進入夜晚，並且在一次比平常更令人痛心的官方殘忍行為之後，我夢到一位猶太女人在得到俄羅斯警方承諾會饒他一命的情況下，背叛了她的丈夫。後來，丈夫知道了誰出賣了他，於是他譴責他的妻子是他最壞的敵人。她跪在地上求饒，說出賣他的唯一動機就是對他的安全感到恐懼，但他再次譴責了她。他的事業已經失敗，他的希望已經破滅，他的人民已經失望，因為上帝給他的唯一支持者是出於她的女性之愛的軟弱，將他交給了他的敵人。我在早晨醒來時，對這個新版的「參孫和得利拉」的故事有著深刻的記憶，回到英格蘭後，我寫了一首以丈夫和妻子的事件為中心情況的劇本草案。</p>
<p>How from this germ came the novel which was published last year under
the title of "The Eternal City" would be a long story to tell, a story
of many personal experiences, of reading, of travel, of meetings in
various countries with<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00003" title="vi"><a id="Page_vi" title="vi"></a></span> statesmen, priests, diplomats, police
authorities, labour leaders, nihilists and anarchists, and of the
consequent growth of my own political and religious convictions; but it
will not be difficult to see where and in what way time and thought had
little by little overlaid the humanities of the early sketch with many
extra interests. That these interests were of the essence, clothing, and
not crushing the human motive, I trust I may continue to believe, and
certainly I have no reason to be dissatisfied with the reception of my
book at the hands of that wide circle of general readers who care less
for a contribution to a great social propaganda than for a simple tale
of love.</p><p>如何從這個種子發展出去年以"永恆之城"為題出版的小說，將會是一個長篇的故事，包含了許多個人經驗、閱讀、旅行、在各國與政治家、神職人員、外交官、警察當局、勞工領導者、虛無主義者和無政府主義者的會面，以及我的政治信仰和宗教信仰的隨之成長。但我們不難看出，時間和思想如何一點一滴地把早期素描的人文精神覆蓋上了許多額外的興趣。我相信這些興趣是人類動機的本質，是裝著，而不是壓迫。我希望我可以繼續相信這一點，當然，我對我的書被那些更關心一個簡單的愛情故事，而不是對偉大的社會宣傳做出貢獻的廣大讀者群接受，我無緣不滿。</p>
<p>But when the time came to return to my first draft of a play, the tale
of love was the only thing to consider, and being now on the point of
producing the drama in England, America, and elsewhere, and requested to
prepare an edition of my story for the use of the audiences at the
theatre, I have thought myself justified in eliminating the politics and
religion from my book, leaving nothing but the human interests with
which alone the drama is allowed to deal. This has not been an easy
thing to do, and now that it is done I am by no means sure that I may
not have alienated the friends whom the abstract problems won for me
without conciliating the readers who called for the story only. But not
to turn my back on the work of three laborious years, or to discredit
that part of it which expressed, however imperfectly, my sympathy with
the struggles of the poor, and my participation in the social problems
with which the world is now astir, I have obtained the promise of my
publisher that the original version of "The Eternal City" shall be kept
in print as long as the public calls for it.</p><p>但當我回到我劇本的初稿時，愛的故事是唯一需要考慮的事情。現在我正準備在英國、美國和其他地方上演這部戲劇，並被要求為劇院的觀眾準備我的故事的版本，我認為我有理由把政治和宗教從我的書中剔除，只留下人的利益，只有這樣戲劇才能處理這些利益。這並不是一件容易的事，現在這件事已經做完，我並不確定我是否可能已經失去了那些因抽象問題而贏得的朋友，而沒有讓那些只要求故事的讀者感到滿意。但是我不打算背棄那三年辛勤工作的成果，也不打算忽視那部分表達我對窮人掙扎的同情以及我對當今世介面臨的社會問題參與的部分，我已獲得出版商的承諾，只要公眾需要，我將保持列印原版的《永恆之城》。</p>
<p>In this form of my book, the aim has been to rely solely on the
humanities and to go back to the simple story of the woman who denounced
her husband in order to save his life. That was the theme of the draft
which was the original basis of my novel, it is the central incident of
the drama which is about to be produced in New York, and the present
abbreviated version of the story is intended to follow the lines of the
play in all essential particulars down to the end of the last chapter
but one.</p><p>在這種形式的書中，目標一直是僅依賴人文學科，並回到那個為了拯救丈夫生命而揭發他的簡單故事。這就是我小說原始草案的主題，也是即將在紐約上演的劇本中的核心事件。現在這個版本的故事有意按照戲劇的所有重要內容來展開，一直到倒數第二章的結尾。</p>

</div>
<h3 id="pgepubid00006">I</h3>
<p>He was hardly fit to figure in the great review of life. A boy of ten or
twelve, in tattered clothes, with an accordion in a case swung over one
shoulder like a sack, and under the other arm a wooden cage containing a
grey squirrel. It was a December night in London, and the Southern lad
had nothing to shelter his little body from the Northern cold but his
short velveteen jacket, red waistcoat, and knickerbockers. He was going
home after a long day in Chelsea, and, conscious of something fantastic
in his appearance, and of doubtful legality in his calling, he was
dipping into side streets in order to escape the laughter of the London
boys and the attentions of policemen.</p><p>他幾乎無法在生命的大回顧中出現。一個十歲或十二歲的男孩，衣衫破爛，肩上掛著一隻手風琴，手風琴的盒子就像袋子一樣掛在他的肩膀上，他的手臂下夾著一個木籠，籠子裡有一隻灰色的松鼠。那是倫敦的一個十二月夜晚，這個南方的孩子只有他的短絨絨夾克，紅色背心和短褲可以保護他的小身體免於北方的寒冷。他在結束了在切爾西的漫長一天後正在回家，深感自己的外貌有些奇特，他的職業合法性存疑，他正在偷偷溜進小巷，以避開倫敦男孩們的嘲笑和警察的關注。</p>
<p>Coming to the Italian quarter in Soho, he stopped at the door of a shop
to see the time. It was eight o'clock. There was an hour to wait before
he would be allowed to go indoors. The shop was a baker's, and the
window was full of cakes and confectionery. From an iron grid on the
pavement there came the warm breath of the oven underground, the red
glow of the fire, and the scythe-like swish of the long shovels. The boy
blocked the squirrel under his armpit, dived into his pocket, and
brought out some copper coins and counted them. There was ninepence.
Ninepence was the sum he had to take home every night, and there was not
a halfpenny to spare. He knew that perfectly before he began to count,
but his appetite had tempted him to try again if his arithmetic was not
at fault.</p><p>他來到蘇豪區的義大利區，停在一家商店的門口看時間。現在是八點鐘，他還要等一個小時才能進屋。這家商店是一家麵包店，窗戶裡滿是蛋糕和糖果。從人行道上的鐵柵中傳來地下烤箱的溫熱氣息，火光的紅暈，以及長鏟劃過的像鐮刀的嘶嘶聲。男孩將松鼠夾在腋下，伸手進口袋，取出一些銅幣數了數。總共有九便士。他每晚必須帶九便士回家，一個半便士也不能少。他在開始數之前就知道這一點，但他的飽食慾已經誘使他再次嘗試，以確認自己的算術是否有錯。</p>
<p>The air grew warmer, and it began to snow. At first it was a fine
sprinkle that made a snow-mist, and adhered wherever it fell. The
traffic speedily became less, and things looked big in the thick air.
The boy was wandering aimlessly<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00007" title="2"><a id="Page_2" title="2"></a></span> through the streets, waiting for nine
o'clock. When he thought the hour was near, he realised that he had lost
his way. He screwed up his eyes to see if he knew the houses and shops
and signs, but everything seemed strange.</p><p>空氣變得更暖和了，開始下起雪來。起初是細微的揮灑造成了一片雪霧，並在它落下的地方黏附。交通很快就少了，空氣濃厚的狀態下，事物看起來琳瑯滿目。這個男孩在街頭 aimlessly 閑逛，等待著九點鐘的到來。當他以為那個時間快到時，他意識到自己迷路了。他把眼睛張得大大的看看他是否認識這些房子、商店和標誌，但是所有的東西似乎都變得陌生。</p>
<p>The snow snowed on, and now it fell in large, corkscrew flakes. The boy
brushed them from his face, but at the next moment they blinded him
again. The few persons still in the streets loomed up on him out of the
darkness, and passed in a moment like gigantic shadows. He tried to ask
his way, but nobody would stand long enough to listen. One man who was
putting up his shutters shouted some answer that was lost in the
drumlike rumble of all voices in the falling snow.</p><p>雪花繼續下著，現在變成了大片的螺旋體。那男孩揮動手臂，將臉上的雪花掃走，但下一刻，他的視線再次被雪花遮蔽。街上剩下的幾個人在黑暗中突然出現在他面前，然後像巨大的影子一樣在瞬間消失。他試圖問路，但沒有人願意停下來聆聽。一個正在關閉他的窗戶的人喊出了某種答案，但在落雪中所有聲音如鼓聲般的隆隆聲中丟失了。</p>
<p>The boy came up to a big porch with four pillars, and stepped in to rest
and reflect. The long tunnels of smoking lights which had receded down
the streets were not to be seen from there, and so he knew that he was
in a square. It would be Soho Square, but whether he was on the south or
east of it he could not tell, and consequently he was at a loss to know
which way to turn. A great silence had fallen over everything, and only
the sobbing nostrils of the cab-horses seemed to be audible in the
hollow air.</p><p>這個男孩走上了一個有四根柱子的大門廊，停下來休息和反思。那些沿街退去的煙霧燈的長隧道在那裡看不見，所以他知道他在一個廣場上。那應該是蘇豪廣場，但他無法判斷自己是在南邊還是東邊，因此他不知道該往哪個方向走。一片沉寂籠罩了一切，只有出租馬車馬的鼻息聲在空曠的空氣中似乎聽得見。</p>
<p>He was very cold. The snow had got into his shoes, and through the rents
in his cross-gartered stockings. His red waistcoat wanted buttons, and
he could feel that his shirt was wet. He tried to shake the snow off by
stamping, but it clung to his velveteens. His numbed fingers could
scarcely hold the cage, which was also full of snow. By the light coming
from a fanlight over the door in the porch he looked at his squirrel.
The little thing was trembling pitifully in its icy bed, and he took it
out and breathed on it to warm it, and then put it in his bosom. The
sound of a child's voice laughing and singing came to him from within
the house, muffled by the walls and the door. Across the white vapour
cast outward from the fanlight he could see nothing but the crystal
snowflakes falling wearily.</p><p>他感到非常的寒冷。雪已經進入他的鞋子，並穿過他的交叉綁腿襪子中的破洞。他的紅色背心缺少鈕扣，他可以感覺到他的襯衫已經濕透。他試圖透過踩踏來甩掉雪，但它卻緊緊黏附在他的燕麥紡布褲上。他的手指冰冷得幾乎不能牢牢握住籠子，籠子裡也充滿了雪。他在門廊上方的風扇燈的燈光下看著他的松鼠。小東西在它的冰床上痛苦地顫抖，他把它拿出來對它吹氣以讓它變暖，然後將它放入他的懷裡。從房子內部傳來的一個孩子的聲音，笑著和唱著，卻被牆壁和門悶住了。進門間由風扇燈外釋放出的白霧後方，他看不出任何東西，只有晶瑩的雪花疲倦地落下。</p>
<p>He grew dizzy, and sat down by one of the pillars. After a while a
shiver passed along his spine, and then he became warm and felt sleepy.
A church clock struck nine, and he started up with a guilty feeling, but
his limbs were stiff and he sank back again, blew two or three breaths
on to the squirrel inside his waistcoat, and fell into a doze. As he
dropped off into unconsciousness he seemed to see the big, cheerless
house, almost destitute of furniture, where he lived with<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00008" title="3"><a id="Page_3" title="3"></a></span> thirty or
forty other boys. They trooped in with their organs and accordions,
counted out their coppers to a man with a clipped moustache, who was
blowing whiffs of smoke from a long, black cigar, with a straw through
it, and then sat down on forms to eat their plates of macaroni and
cheese. The man was not in good temper to-night, and he was shouting at
some who were coming in late and at others who were sharing their supper
with the squirrels that nestled in their bosoms, or the monkeys, in red
jacket and fez, that perched upon their shoulders. The boy was perfectly
unconscious by this time, and the child within the house was singing
away as if her little breast was a cage of song-birds.</p><p>他開始覺得頭暈，便坐在一根柱子旁。過了一會兒，他的脊椎傳來一陣寒意，然後他覺得暖和，有些睏倦。教堂的鐘聲敲響九點，他驚恐地起身，但他的四肢僵硬，只能再次坐回去，向他的腰帶裡的松鼠吹了兩三口氣，然後陷入了昏睡。當他進入昏睡狀態時，他彷彿看到了他和其他三十或四十個男孩一起生活的那座大而冷漠的房子，裡面幾乎沒什麼傢俱。他們帶著他們的風琴和手風琴進來，把銅板數給一個修剪過鬍子的男人，這個男人正在用一根吸管抽著一根長長的黑雪茄，然後他們坐在座位上吃他們的通心粉和乳酪。那個男人今晚心情不好，他對一些晚進來的人和一些與他們的雜碎或者他們胸口的松鼠，甚至肩膀上穿著紅夾克和穿著紅色羽絨帽的猴子分享晚餐的人大喊大叫。這個時候，男孩已經完全失去了知覺，而屋子裡的那個孩子正在歌唱，就像她的小胸膤裡關著一籠鳥兒一樣。</p>
<p>As the church clock struck nine a class of Italian lads in an upper room
in Old Compton Street was breaking up for the night, and the teacher,
looking out of the window, said:</p><p>當教堂鐘擊響九點時，一群在Old Compton街的樓上房間的義大利小夥子的課程結束了，老師看著窗外說：</p>
<p>"While we have been telling the story of the great road to our country a
snowstorm has come, and we shall have enough to do to find our road
home."</p><p>在我們講述通往我們國家的偉大道路的故事時，一場大雪來襲，我們將需要付出很大的努力才能找到回家的路。</p>
<p>The lads laughed by way of answer, and cried: "Good-night, doctor."</p><p>那些小夥子以笑聲作為回答，並叫喊著：“晚安，醫生。”</p>
<p>"Good-night, boys, and God bless you," said the teacher.</p><p>"晚安，孩子們，上帝保佑你們," 老師說。</p>
<p>He was an elderly man, with a noble forehead and a long beard. His face,
a sad one, was lighted up by a feeble smile; his voice was soft, and his
manner gentle. When the boys were gone he swung over his shoulders a
black cloak with a red lining, and followed them into the street.</p><p>他是一位年長的男士，擁有高貴的額頭和長長的鬍子。他的臉上帶著悲哀，微弱的笑容照亮了他的臉龐；他的聲音溫和，舉止文雅。當男孩們離去後，他披上一件黑色內裡為紅色的斗篷，跟隨他們走進街頭。</p>
<p>He had not gone far into the snowy haze before he began to realise that
his playful warning had not been amiss.</p><p>他走進雪霧中不遠就開始意識到，他之前調皮的警告並非空穴來風。</p>
<p>"Well, well," he thought, "only a few steps, and yet so difficult to
find."</p><p>"嗯嗯，"他想，"只有幾步，卻如此難找。"</p>
<p>He found the right turnings at last, and coming to the porch of his
house in Soho Square, he almost trod on a little black and white object
lying huddled at the base of one of the pillars.</p><p>他終於找到了正確的轉彎處，來到了他在蘇豪廣場的房子的門廊，他差點踩到一個小小的黑白物體，那物體縮在其中一根柱子的底部。</p>
<p>"A boy," he thought, "sleeping out on a night like this! Come, come," he
said severely, "this is wrong," and he shook the little fellow to waken
him.</p><p>"一個男孩," 他想, "在這樣的夜晚露宿！來，來," 他嚴肅地說, "這是錯的," 然後他搖醒了這個小傢伙。</p>
<p>The boy did not answer, but he began to mutter in a sleepy monotone,
"Don't hit me, sir. It was snow. I'll not come home late again.
Ninepence, sir, and Jinny is so cold."</p><p>那個男孩沒有回答，但他開始以昏昏欲睡的單調聲音嘀咕，
"先生，請不要打我。那是雪。我不會再遲到了。
九便士，先生，Jinny太冷了。"</p>
<p>The man paused a moment, then turned to the door rang the bell sharply.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00009" title="4"><a id="Page_4" title="4"></a></span></p><p>那名男子停頓了一會兒，然後轉向門並猛烈地按鈴。</p>
<h3 id="pgepubid00010">II</h3>
<p>Half-an-hour later the little musician was lying on a couch in the
doctor's surgery, a cheerful room with a fire and a soft lamp under a
shade. He was still unconscious, but his damp clothes had been taken off
and he was wrapped in blankets. The doctor sat at the boy's head and
moistened his lips with brandy, while a good woman, with the face of a
saint, knelt at the end of the couch and rubbed his little feet and
legs. After a little while there was a perceptible quivering of the
eyelids and twitching of the mouth.</p><p>半小時後，小音樂家躺在醫生的診療室裡，那是一間明亮的房間，有一個火爐和軟燈下的燈罩。他還處在昏迷中，但他濕透的衣服已經脫掉，他被包裹在毯子裡。醫生坐在男孩的頭部，用白蘭地潤澤他的嘴唇。而一位有著聖人面孔的好女人，跪在沙發的底部，揉搓他的小腳和腿。過了一會兒，他的眼皮顯然在顫抖，嘴巴也在抽動。</p>
<p>"He is coming to, mother," said the doctor.</p><p>"他正在恢復過來，母親，"醫生說。</p>
<p>"At last," said his wife.</p><p>"終於，"他的妻子說。</p>
<p>The boy moaned and opened his eyes, the big helpless eyes of childhood,
black as a sloe, and with long black lashes. He looked at the fire, the
lamp, the carpet, the blankets, the figures at either end of the couch,
and with a smothered cry he raised himself as though thinking to escape.</p><p>男孩呻吟著，睜開了他的眼睛，那是一雙充滿無助的大眼睛，像黑刺李般黑，長著黑色的睫毛。他看了看火、燈、地毯、毯子，還有沙發兩頭的人影，然後他忍住哭聲坐了起來，彷彿在想要逃脫。</p>
<p>"Carino!" said the doctor, smoothing the boy's curly hair. "Lie still a
little longer."</p><p>"親愛的!" 醫生說，撫平男孩的捲曲頭髮。 "再躺一會兒。"</p>
<p>The voice was like a caress, and the boy sank back. But presently he
raised himself again, and gazed around the room as if looking for
something. The good mother understood him perfectly, and from a chair on
which his clothes were lying she picked up his little grey squirrel. It
was frozen stiff with the cold and now quite dead, but he grasped it
tightly and kissed it passionately, while big teardrops rolled on to his
cheeks.</p><p>那聲音就像是撫摸，男孩往後倒下。但他很快又坐起來，四處環顧房間，好像在找東西。好心的母親完全瞭解他在想什麼，她從靠椅上的衣服中拿出他的小灰松鼠。這隻松鼠因為寒冷已經凍僵，現在已經死了，但他還是緊緊地握著它，情熱地親吻它，大淚珠從他的面頰滾落。
</p>
<p>"Carino!" said the doctor again, taking the dead squirrel away, and
after a while the boy lay quiet and was comforted.</p><p>"親愛的!"醫生再次說道，並帶走了那隻死去的松鼠。過了一會兒，男孩安靜下來，感到了安慰。</p>
<p>"Italiano—si?"</p><p>義大利語 - 是嗎？</p>
<p>"Si, Signore."</p><p>是的，先生。</p>
<p>"From which province?"</p><p>來自哪個省份？</p>
<p>"Campagna Romana, Signore."</p><p>"羅馬鄉村，先生。"</p>
<p>"Where does he say he comes from, doctor?"</p><p>他說他來自哪裡，醫生？</p>
<p>"From the country district outside Rome. And now you are living at
Maccari's in Greek Street—isn't that so?"</p><p>"來自羅馬外的鄉村區。現在你住在希臘街的馬卡裡的地方，是這樣嗎？"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."</p><p>是的，先生。</p>
<p>"How long have you been in England—one year, two years?"<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00011" title="5"><a id="Page_5" title="5"></a></span></p><p>你在英國待了多久-一年，兩年？</p>
<p>"Two years and a half, sir."</p><p>兩年半，先生。</p>
<p>"And what is your name, my son?"</p><p>那麼，你的名字是什麼，我的兒子？</p>
<p>"David Leone."</p><p>大衛·利奧內</p>
<p>"A beautiful name, carino! David Le-o-ne," repeated the doctor,
smoothing the curly hair.</p><p>"美麗的名字，親愛的！大衛·萊歐內，"醫生重複說著，一邊撫平他的捲髮。</p>
<p>"A beautiful boy, too! What will you do with him, doctor?"</p><p>這個男孩也很帥！醫生，你打算怎麼辦？</p>
<p>"Keep him here to-night at all events, and to-morrow we'll see if some
institution will not receive him. David Leone! Where have I heard that
name before, I wonder? Your father is a farmer?"</p><p>"無論如何，今晚請把他留在這裡，明天我們看看是否有機構會接受他。大衛·萊昂！我在哪裡聽過這個名字，我在想呢？你的父親是農民嗎？"</p>
<p>But the boy's face had clouded like a mirror that has been breathed
upon, and he made no answer.</p><p>但男孩的臉孔卻像被呼吸霧化過的鏡子一樣變得朦朧，他沒有回答。</p>
<p>"Isn't your father a farmer in the Campagna Romana, David?"</p><p>“大衛，你的父親不是羅馬農田的農民嗎？”</p>
<p>"I have no father," said the boy.</p><p>"我沒有爸爸," 小男孩說。</p>
<p>"Carino! But your mother is alive—yes?"</p><p>親愛的！但你的母親還活著—對嗎?</p>
<p>"I have no mother."</p><p>我沒有母親。</p>
<p>"Caro mio! Caro mio! You shall not go to the institution to-morrow, my
son," said the doctor, and then the mirror cleared in a moment as if the
sun had shone on it.</p><p>"親愛的孩子！親愛的孩子！你明天不應該去機構，"醫生說，然後鏡子在一瞬間變得明亮，就像太陽照射在上面一樣。</p>
<p>"Listen, father!"</p><p>聽著，父親！</p>
<p>Two little feet were drumming on the floor above.</p><p>兩隻小腳正在樓上的地板上敲打。</p>
<p>"Baby hasn't gone to bed yet. She wouldn't sleep until she had seen the
boy, and I had to promise she might come down presently."</p><p>寶寶還沒有上床睡覺。她要等到見到那個男孩才願意睡覺，我必須承諾她稍後可以下來。</p>
<p>"Let her come down now," said the doctor.</p><p>"讓她現在下來,"醫生說。</p>
<p>The boy was supping a basin of broth when the door burst open with a
bang, and like a tiny cascade which leaps and bubbles in the sunlight, a
little maid of three, with violet eyes, golden complexion, and glossy
black hair, came bounding into the room. She was trailing behind her a
train of white nightdress, hobbling on the portion in front, and
carrying under her arm a cat, which, being held out by the neck, was
coiling its body and kicking its legs like a rabbit.</p><p>男孩正在喝一碗湯，突然門砰的一聲開啟，就像太陽下泡沫飛濺的小瀑布，一個三歲的小女孩進入了房間。她有紫羅蘭色的眼睛，金黃色的膚色，光滑的黑頭髮。她跟在身後拖著白色的睡衣，前面的部分跛腳行走，而她的手臂下卻抱著一隻貓。貓被她緊緊抓著脖子，身體蜷曲，腿部像兔子一樣蹬踏著。</p>
<p>But having entered with so fearless a front, the little woman drew up
suddenly at sight of the boy, and, entrenching herself behind the
doctor, began to swing by his coat-tails, and to take furtive glances at
the stranger in silence and aloofness.</p><p>但是，這名小婦人無畏地走進來後，突然在看到那個男孩的時候停下，然後她躲在醫生的身後，開始拉他的外套尾巴，並且默默地、疏遠地偷偷瞥著那個陌生人。</p>
<p>"Bless their hearts! what funny things they are, to be sure," said the
mother. "Somebody seems to have been telling<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00012" title="6"><a id="Page_6" title="6"></a></span> her she might have a
brother some day, and when nurse said to Susanna, 'The doctor has
brought a boy home with him to-night,' nothing was so sure as that this
was the brother they had promised her, and yet now ... Roma, you silly
child, why don't you come and speak to the poor boy who was nearly
frozen to death in the snow?"</p><p>“真是他們的幸運！他們是多麼有趣的事物，"母親說。"似乎有人告訴她她可能有一天會有個弟弟，護士對蘇珊娜說，'醫生今晚把一個男孩帶回家了，'沒有什麼比這更確定了，這就是他們承諾給她的弟弟，但是現在…羅馬，你這個傻孩子，為什麼你不過來和這個幾乎在雪中被凍死的可憐男孩說話？”</p>
<p>But Roma's privateering fingers were now deep in her father's pocket, in
search of a specimen of the sugar-stick which seemed to live and grow
there. She found two sugar-sticks this time, and sight of a second
suggested a bold adventure. Sidling up toward the couch, but still
holding on to the doctor's coat-tails, like a craft that swings to
anchor, she tossed one of the sugar-sticks on to the floor at the boy's
side. The boy smiled and picked it up, and this being taken for
sufficient masculine response, the little daughter of Eve proceeded to
proper overtures.</p><p>但是，羅馬的小手現在已經深深地摸進了她父親的口袋裡，尋找那似乎在裡面生長的糖棒。這次她找到了兩根糖棒，看到第二根糖棒，她產生了一種大膽的冒險精神。她向沙發悄悄地躡手躡腳地靠近，但仍然抓住醫生的大衣尾巴，像一艘停泊的船，她把一根糖棒扔到了男孩的身邊的地板上。男孩笑了笑並撿起來，這被認為是充分的男性回應，於是，這個小女孩像夏娃的女兒一樣開始進行適當的示好行為。</p>
<p>"Oo a boy?"</p><p>哦，一個男孩？</p>
<p>The boy smiled again and assented.</p><p>那個男孩再次微笑並同意。</p>
<p>"Oo me brodder?"</p><p>哦，是我哥哥嗎？</p>
<p>The boy's smile paled perceptibly.</p><p>那個男孩的笑容明顯變得蒼白。</p>
<p>"Oo lub me?"</p><p>你愛我嗎？</p>
<p>The tide in the boy's eyes was rising rapidly.</p><p>男孩眼中的潮汐正在迅速上升。</p>
<p>"Oo lub me eber and eber?"</p><p>你會永遠愛我嗎？</p>
<p>The tears were gathering fast, when the doctor, smoothing the boy's dark
curls again, said:</p><p>當醫生再次撫平男孩的黑色捲髮時，淚水已經快速的湧現出來，他說道:</p>
<p>"You have a little sister of your own far away in the Campagna
Romana—yes?"</p><p>你在遙遠的羅馬鄉野裡有一個自己的小妹妹，對嗎？</p>
<p>"No, sir."</p><p>不，先生。</p>
<p>"Perhaps it's a brother?"</p><p>也許是兄弟？</p>
<p>"I ... I have nobody," said the boy, and his voice broke on the last
word with a thud.</p><p>"我...我無人可依賴，"這男孩說，他的聲音在最後一個詞語中戛然而止。</p>
<p>"You shall not go to the institution at all, David," said the doctor
softly.</p><p>"你絕對不該去那個機構，大衛，"醫生輕聲說。</p>
<p>"Doctor Roselli!" exclaimed his wife. But something in the doctor's face
smote her instantly and she said no more.</p><p>"羅塞利醫生!"他的妻子驚叫道。但醫生臉上的某種表情立刻打動了她，她再也沒有說什麼。</p>
<p>"Time for bed, baby."</p><p>寶貝，該睡覺了。</p>
<p>But baby had many excuses. There were the sugar-sticks, and the pussy,
and the boy-brother, and finally her prayers to say.</p><p>但是寶寶有很多藉口。那裡有糖棒，還有小貓，她的弟弟，最後還有她要禱告。</p>
<p>"Say them here, then, sweetheart," said her mother, and with her cat
pinned up again under one arm and the sugar-stick held under the other,
kneeling face to the fire, but screwing<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00013" title="7"><a id="Page_7" title="7"></a></span> her half-closed eyes at
intervals in the direction of the couch, the little maid put her little
waif-and-stray hands together and said:</p><p>"在這裡說出來，親愛的，"她的母親說。小女孩把她的貓再次夾在一隻胳膊下，糖棒夾在另一隻胳膊下，面向火源下跪，卻在不時地透過半閉的眼睛朝著躺椅的方向瞥去。這個小女僕把她的小小的流浪孤兒的雙手合在一起說:</p>
<p>"Our Fader oo art in Heben, alud be dy name. Dy kingum tum. Dy will be
done on eard as it is in Heben. Gib us dis day our dayey bread, and
forgib us our trelspasses as we forgib dem dat trelspass ayenst us. And
lee us not into temstashuns, but deliber us from ebil ... for eber and
eber. Amen."</p><p>我們在天上的父，願人都尊你的名為聖。願你的國降臨，願你的旨意行在地上，如同在天上。求你今日賜給我們日用的食物，以及赦免我們的錯誤，如同我們赦免別人一樣。不讓我們陷入誘惑，但救我們免於邪惡...直到永遠。阿門。</p>
<p>The house in Soho Square was perfectly silent an hour afterward. In the
surgery the lamp was turned down, the cat was winking and yawning at the
fire, and the doctor sat in a chair in front of the fading glow and
listened to the measured breathing of the boy behind him. It dropped at
length, like a pendulum that is about to stop, into the noiseless beat
of innocent sleep, and then the good man got up and looked down at the
little head on the pillow.</p><p>蘇荷廣場的房子在一個小時後完全安靜下來。在診所裡燈光調暗，貓在火堆旁眨眼打哈欠，醫生坐在逐漸黯淡的光火前聆聽背後男孩規律的呼吸聲。最後，就像即將停止的鐘擺一樣，陷入了無聲的天真睡眠的節拍，然後這位好人起身，俯視著枕頭上的小腦袋。</p>
<p>Even with the eyes closed it was a beautiful face; one of the type which
great painters have loved to paint for their saints and angels—sweet,
soft, wise, and wistful. And where did it come from? From the Campagna
Romana, a scene of poverty, of squalor, of fever, and of death!</p><p>即使閉上眼睛，這也是張美麗的臉龐。這種面孔就是那些偉大的畫家喜歡為他們的聖人和天使描繪的那一種——溫柔，聰明，又有些許憂鬱。它來自哪裡呢？來自羅馬田園，一個貧窮、骯髒、疾病和死亡的地方！</p>
<p>The doctor thought of his own little daughter, whose life had been a
long holiday, and then of the boy whose days had been an unbroken
bondage.</p><p>醫生想到自己的小女兒，她的生活一直如假日般快樂，然後又想到那個男孩，他的日子一直在無盡的奴役中度過。</p>
<p>"Yet who knows but in the rough chance of life our little Roma may not
some day ... God forbid!"</p><p>然而，誰知道在生活的艱難抉擇中，我們的小羅馬可能有一天...但願上帝不會讓這種情況發生！</p>
<p>The boy moved in his sleep and laughed the laugh of a dream that is like
the sound of a breeze in soft summer grass, and it broke the thread of
painful reverie.</p><p>男孩在睡夢中翻身，他的笑聲如同夏日柔軟草地中微風的聲音，打破了痛苦沉思的思緒。</p>
<p>"Poor little man! he has forgotten all his troubles."</p><p>可憐的小男子！他已忘記了所有的煩惱。</p>
<p>Perhaps he was back in his sunny Italy by this time, among the vines and
the oranges and the flowers, running barefoot with other children on the
dazzling whiteness of the roads!... Perhaps his mother in heaven was
praying her heart out to the Blessed Virgin to watch over her fatherless
darling cast adrift upon the world!</p><p>也許他此時已經回到了陽光燦爛的義大利，在葡萄樹、橙樹和花朵中間，和其他孩子們一起在耀眼的白色道路上光著腳丫奔跑！也許他在天堂的母親正虔誠地向聖母瑪利亞祈禱，盼她看護自己失去父親、在世界上流浪的可愛寶貝！</p>
<p>The train of thought was interrupted by voices in the street, and the
doctor drew the curtain of the window aside and looked out. The snow had
ceased to fall, and the moon was shining; the leafless trees were
casting their delicate black shadows on the whitened ground, and the
yellow light of<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00014" title="8"><a id="Page_8" title="8"></a></span> a lantern on the opposite angle of the square showed
where a group of lads were singing a Christmas carol.</p><p>思考的線索被街上的聲音打斷，醫生拉開窗簾望了出去。雪停止了下落，月亮照耀著大地；沒有葉子的樹們在被雪覆蓋的地上投下細緻的黑影，而廣場對面角落的一盞黃燈顯露出一群少年正在唱聖誕頌歌的地方。</p>
<p>
"While shepherds watched their flocks by night, all seated on the ground,<br/>
The angel of the Lord came down, and glory shone around."<br/>
</p><p>"當牧羊人夜裡看守群羊，都坐在地上，
主的天使降臨，周圍光榮照耀。"</p>
<p>Doctor Roselli closed the curtain, put out the lamp, touched with his
lips the forehead of the sleeping boy, and went to bed.</p><p>羅塞利醫生拉上了窗簾，熄滅了燈，用他的嘴唇輕觸了熟睡男孩的前額，然後去睡覺。</p>

<h3 id="pgepubid00017">TWENTY YEARS LATER<br/>
I</h3>
<p>It was the last day of the century. In a Bull proclaiming a Jubilee the
Pope had called his faithful children to Rome, and they had come from
all quarters of the globe. To salute the coming century, and to dedicate
it, in pomp and solemn ceremony, to the return of the world to the Holy
Church, one and universal, the people had gathered in the great Piazza
of St. Peter.</p><p>那是世紀的最後一天。教皇在宣佈聖年大赦的牛令中呼籲他的忠誠信徒來到羅馬，他們從全球各地蜂擁而至。為了歡迎新世紀的到來，並透過隆重和莊重的儀式，將新的世紀奉獻給全世界人們重返的那個聖潔且普遍的教會，人們聚集在聖彼得大廣場上。</p>
<p>Boys and women were climbing up every possible elevation, and a
bright-faced girl who had conquered a high place on the base of the
obelisk was chattering down at a group of her friends who were listening
to their cicerone.</p><p>男孩和女人們正在攀登每一個可能的高地，一個面色明亮的女孩已經攀登到了方尖碑的底部，她在向一群正在聽導覽員解說的朋友嘮叨。</p>
<p>"Yes, that is the Vatican," said the guide, pointing to a square
building at the back of the colonnade, "and the apartments of the Pope
are those on the third floor, just on the level of the Loggia of
Raphael. The Cardinal Secretary of State used to live in the rooms
below, opening on the grand staircase that leads from the Court of
Damasus. There's a private way up to the Pope's apartment, and a secret
passage to the Castle of St. Angelo."</p><p>"對，那就是梵蒂岡，"導遊指著柱廊後面的一棟方形建築物說，"教皇的公寓就在三樓，正好在拉斐爾的走廊的層面上。樞機國務秘書長的住所，就在下方的房間，開在從達馬修斯庭院通往的大樓梯。有一條私人通道通往教皇的公寓，還有一條秘密通道到達聖安吉洛城堡。"</p>
<p>"Say, has the Pope got that secret passage still?"</p><p>說，教皇還有那個秘密通道嗎？</p>
<p>"No, sir. When the Castle went over to the King the connection with the
Vatican was cut off. Ah, everything is changed since those days! The
Pope used to go to St. Peter's surrounded by his Cardinals and Bishops,
to the roll of drums and the roar of cannon. All that is over now. The
present Pope is trying to revive the old condition seemingly, but what
can he do? Even the Bull proclaiming the Jubilee laments the loss of the
temporal power which would have permitted him to renew the enchantments
of the Holy City."</p><p>"不，先生。當城堡歸王所有時，與梵蒂岡的聯絡就被切斷了。啊，自那些日子以來，一切都變了！教皇曾經在他的樞機主教和主教的環繞下，到聖彼得大教堂，伴隨著鼓聲和炮聲。現在，這一切都結束了。現任教皇似乎正在嘗試恢復舊的狀況，但他能做什麼呢？即使是宣告聖年的公牛，也對失去了可以讓他重現聖城魅力的世俗權力感到遺憾。"</p>
<p>"Tell him it's just lovely as it is," said the girl on the obelisk, "and
when the illuminations begin...."<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00018" title="10"><a id="Page_10" title="10"></a></span></p><p>"告訴他，這就已經很美了，"塔上的女孩說，“而且當燈光秀開始的時候...."</p>
<p>"Say, friend," said her parent again, "Rome belonged to the Pope—yes?
Then the Italians came in and took it and made it the capital of
Italy—so?"</p><p>"說，朋友,"她的父母再次說，"羅馬屬於教皇，對嗎？然後義大利人進來，奪走了它，並將其變成了義大利的首都，對嗎？"</p>
<p>"Just so, and ever since then the Holy Father has been a prisoner in the
Vatican, going into it as a cardinal and coming out of it as a corpse,
and to-day will be the first time a Pope has set foot in the streets of
Rome!"</p><p>就是這樣，自從那時起，教宗一直被囚禁在梵蒂岡，作為樞機主教進去，但只有以遺體的形式才能出來，今天將是教宗第一次踏上羅馬街頭！</p>
<p>"My! And shall we see him in his prison clothes?"</p><p>哎呀！我們會看到他穿著獄服嗎？</p>
<p>"Lilian Martha! Don't you know enough for that? Perhaps you expect to
see his chains and a straw of his bed in the cell? The Pope is a king
and has a court—that's the way I am figuring it."</p><p>"莉蓮·瑪莎！你就算了解那麼多了嗎？你也許期待看到他的鎖鏈和牢房裡的床上的稻草？教皇是國王，並且擁有一個法庭——那就是我是如何看待它的。"</p>
<p>"True, the Pope is a sovereign still, and he is surrounded by his
officers of state—Cardinal Secretary, Majordomo, Master of Ceremonies,
Steward, Chief of Police, Swiss Guards, Noble Guard and Palatine Guard,
as well as the Papal Guard who live in the garden and patrol the
precincts night and day."</p><p>的確，教皇仍然是一位元首，他的身邊環繞著他的國家公務員 - 樞機秘書，大管家，儀式主管，管家，警察局長，瑞士衛隊，貴族衛隊和宮廷衛隊，以及住在花園中並且日夜巡邏範圍的教宗衛隊。</p>
<p>"Then where the nation ... prisoner, you say?"</p><p>那麼，你說那個國家...囚犯在哪裡？</p>
<p>"Prisoner indeed! Not even able to look out of his windows on to this
piazza on the 20th of September without the risk of insult and
outrage—and Heaven knows what will happen when he ventures out to-day!"</p><p>確實是囚徒！即使只是想在9月20日透過自家窗戶看這個廣場，也會冒著被羞辱和冒犯的風險——而且天知道他今天出門會發生什麼事！</p>
<p>"Well! this goes clear ahead of me!"</p><p>嗯！這完全超出我的理解範圍！</p>
<p>Beyond the outer cordon of troops many carriages were drawn up in
positions likely to be favourable for a view of the procession. In one
of these sat a Frenchman in a coat covered with medals, a florid,
fiery-eyed old soldier with bristling white hair. Standing by his
carriage door was a typical young Roman, fashionable, faultlessly
dressed, pallid, with strong lower jaw, dark watchful eyes, twirled-up
moustache and cropped black mane.</p><p>在士兵的外層警戒線之外，許多馬車停在可能有利於觀看遊行的位置。在其中一輛馬車上坐著一位法國人，他身穿一件掛滿勳章的外套，是一位面色紅潤，眼神火熱的老兵，他的白髮短硬。站在他馬車門旁的是一個典型的年輕羅馬人，時尚，穿著無懈可擊，面色蒼白，下巴結實，眼睛暗淡而警惕，鬍子盤旋，黑髮修剪整齊。</p>
<p>"Ah, yes," said the old Frenchman. "Much water has run under the bridge
since then, sir. Changed since I was here? Rome? You're right, sir.
'When Rome falls, falls the world;' but it can alter for all that, and
even this square has seen its transformations. Holy Office stands where
it did, the yellow building behind there, but this palace, for
instance—this one with the people in the balcony...."</p><p>"啊，是的，"那位老法國人說。"從那時以來，河水在橋下流淌了許多，先生。羅馬有變化了嗎？你說得對，先生。'當羅馬倒下，世界也會跟著倒下；'但即使如此，它仍可以改變，甚至這個廣場也見證了它的變革。聖辦公室仍然站在那裡，就在那裡的黃色建築物，但這個宮殿，例如——有人在陽臺上的這一個...."</p>
<p>The Frenchman pointed to the travertine walls of a prison-like house on
the farther side of the piazza.</p><p>這位法國人指向廣場另一側的像監獄一樣的房子的石灰華牆。</p>
<p>"Do you know whose palace that is?"<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00019" title="11"><a id="Page_11" title="11"></a></span></p><p>你知道那是誰的皇宮嗎？</p>
<p>"Baron Bonelli's, President of the Council and Minister of the
Interior."</p><p>"波內利男爵，議會主席和內政部長。"</p>
<p>"Precisely! But do you know whose palace it used to be?"</p><p>正確！但你知道這座宮殿過去屬於誰嗎？</p>
<p>"Belonged to the English Wolsey, didn't it, in the days when he wanted
the Papacy?"</p><p>屬於英國的沃爾西，不是嗎？那是他想要入主教宗之位的日子。</p>
<p>"Belonged in my time to the father of the Pope, sir—old Baron Leone!"</p><p>“屬於我的那個時代，教皇的父親，先生——老男爵利奧內！”</p>
<p>"Leone! That's the family name of the Pope, isn't it?"</p><p>萊昂！那是教皇的家族姓氏，對嗎？</p>
<p>"Yes, sir, and the old Baron was a banker and a cripple. One foot in the
grave, and all his hopes centred in his son. 'My son,' he used to say,
'will be the richest man in Rome some day—richer than all their Roman
princes, and it will be his own fault if he doesn't make himself Pope.'"</p><p>"是的，先生，那位老男爵是一位銀行家，也是個殘疾人。他一隻腳已經踏入了墳墓，所有的希望都寄託在他的兒子身上。他常說，'我的兒子有朝一日會成為羅馬最富有的人——比所有的羅馬王子都要富有，如果他不能成為教皇，那將是他自己的錯。'"</p>
<p>"He has, apparently."</p><p>他顯然已經有了。</p>
<p>"Not that way, though. When his father died, he sold up everything, and
having no relations looking to him, he gave away every penny to the
poor. That's how the old banker's palace fell into the hands of the
Prime Minister of Italy—an infidel, an Antichrist."</p><p>不過並非那種方式。當他的父親去世時，他賣掉了所有的東西，而且由於沒有親人指望他，他把每一分錢都給了窮人。這就是老銀行家的宮殿如何落入義大利總理的手中——一個異教徒，一個反基督。</p>
<p>"So the Pope is a good man, is he?"</p><p>那麼，教宗是個好人，是嗎？</p>
<p>"Good man, sir? He's not a man at all, he's an angel! Only two aims in
life—the glory of the Church and the welfare of the rising generation.
Gave away half his inheritance founding homes all over the world for
poor boys. Boys—that's the Pope's tender point, sir! Tell him anything
tender about a boy and he breaks up like an old swordcut."</p><p>好人？吾王，他根本就不是一個人，他是一位天使！他人生中只有兩個目標，就是教會的光榮和新一代的福祉。他在全世界各地建立了為窮苦男孩的庇護所，捐出了一半的遺產。男孩——這是教皇的敏感點，吾王！只要向他述說任何男孩的溫情事蹟，他就會像老劍痕一樣感動得莫名其妙。</p>
<p>The eyes of the young Roman were straying away from the Frenchman to a
rather shabby single-horse hackney carriage which had just come into the
square and taken up its position in the shadow of the grim old palace.
It had one occupant only—a man in a soft black hat. He was quite
without a sign of a decoration, but his arrival had created a general
commotion, and all faces were turning toward him.</p><p>那位年輕的羅馬人的目光從法國人身上移開，轉向剛剛駛進廣場並停在陰暗古老宮殿陰影下的一輛相當破舊的單馬黃包車。車內只有一位乘客，一個戴著柔軟黑帽子的男人。他身上沒有任何裝飾的痕跡，但他的到來卻引起了一片騷動，所有的臉都轉向了他。</p>
<p>"Do you happen to know who that is?" said the gay Roman. "That man in
the cab under the balcony full of ladies? Can it be David Rossi?"</p><p>"你知不知道那是誰？"那位快活的羅馬人問道。"坐在那個滿是女士們陽臺下方的出租車裡的男人？會不會是大衛·羅西？"</p>
<p>"David Rossi, the anarchist?"</p><p>“大衛·羅西，那位無政府主義者？”</p>
<p>"Some people call him so. Do you know him?"</p><p>有些人這麼稱呼他。你認識他嗎？</p>
<p>"I know nothing about the man except that he is an enemy of his
Holiness."</p><p>我對那個男人一無所知，除了他是他的聖潔敵人。</p>
<p>"He intends to present a petition to the Pope this morning,
nevertheless."<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00020" title="12"><a id="Page_12" title="12"></a></span></p><p>他打算今早向教宗提交一份請願書，儘管如此。</p>
<p>"Impossible!"</p><p>不可能！</p>
<p>"Haven't you heard of it? These are his followers with the banners and
badges."</p><p>你還沒聽說過嗎？這些都是他的追隨者，他們帶著旗幟和徽章。</p>
<p>He pointed to the line of working-men who had ranged themselves about
the cab, with banners inscribed variously, "Garibaldi Club," "Mazzini
Club," "Republican Federation," and "Republic of Man."</p><p>他指向了一排勞動人民，他們在出租車周圍排成一行，橫幅上各自寫著"加里波第俱樂部"，"馬志尼俱樂部"，"共和聯盟"和"人類共和國。"</p>
<p>"Your friend Antichrist," tipping a finger over his shoulder in the
direction of the palace, "has been taxing bread to build more
battleships, and Rossi has risen against him. But failing in the press,
in Parliament and at the Quirinal, he is coming to the Pope to pray of
him to let the Church play its old part of intermediary between the poor
and the oppressed."</p><p>"你的朋友敵基督"，他用手指指向宮殿的方向，"一直在對麵包徵稅以建造更多的戰艦，而Rossi已經對他起來反抗。但他在新聞媒體、議會和奎裡納爾皇宮都失敗了，他來見教皇，祈求他讓教會扮演舊日調解貧窮與被壓迫者之間的角色。"</p>
<p>"Preposterous!"</p><p>荒謬！</p>
<p>"So?"</p><p>那又怎樣?</p>
<p>"To whom is the Pope to protest? To the King of Italy who robbed him of
his Holy City? Pretty thing to go down on your knees to the brigand who
has stripped you! And at whose bidding is he to protest? At the bidding
of his bitterest enemy? Pshaw!"</p><p>教宗將向誰抗議？向搶奪他聖城的義大利國王嗎？跪在那個剝削你的土匪面前，這是多麼美妙的事情！他要按照誰的命令來抗議？按照他最大的敵人的命令嗎？哼！</p>
<p>"You persist that David Rossi is an enemy of the Pope?"</p><p>"你堅持認為大衛·羅西是教宗的敵人嗎？"</p>
<p>"The deadliest enemy the Pope has in the world."</p><p>教宗在世界上最致命的敵人。</p>
<h3 id="pgepubid00021">II</h3>
<p>The subject of the Frenchman's denunciation looked harmless enough as he
sat in his hackney carriage under the shadow of old Baron Leone's gloomy
palace. A first glance showed a man of thirty-odd years, tall, slightly
built, inclined to stoop, with a long, clean-shaven face, large dark
eyes, and dark hair which covered the head in short curls of almost
African profusion. But a second glance revealed all the characteristics
that give the hand-to-hand touch with the common people, without which
no man can hope to lead a great movement.</p><p>這位法國人譴責的物件，在老巴倫萊昂的陰暗宮殿下乘坐黑尼馬車時，看起來無害無辜。初看上去，它是一位三十幾歲的男子，身材高大，體型偏瘦，有點佝僂，臉長而光滑，眼睛大而黑，頭上滿是短短的黑色捲髮，繁密得近乎非洲人。但是再一看，所有的特徵都顯示出它與普通百姓有著親密的接觸，沒有這種接觸，任何人都無法希望引領一場大的運動。</p>
<p>From the moment of David Rossi's arrival there was a tingling movement
in the air, and from time to time people approached and spoke to him,
when the tired smile struggled through the jaded face and then slowly
died away. After a while, as if to subdue the sense of personal
observation, he<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00022" title="13"><a id="Page_13" title="13"></a></span> took a pen and oblong notepaper and began to write on
his knees.</p><p>自大衛·羅西到達的那一刻起，空氣中就張力四溢，不時有人前來與他交談，當時他疲態盡現的臉龐掙扎出一絲微笑，隨後又慢慢消逝。過了一會兒，似乎為了壓制對個人觀察的感覺，他拿起一支筆和長方形的筆記紙，開始在他的膝蓋上寫作。</p>
<p>Meantime the quick-eyed facile crowd around him beguiled the tedium of
waiting with good-humoured chaff. One great creature with a shaggy mane
and a sanguinary voice came up, bottle in hand, saluted the downcast
head with a mixture of deference and familiarity, then climbed to the
box-seat beside the driver, and in deepest bass began the rarest
mimicry. He was a true son of the people, and under an appearance of
ferocity he hid the heart of a child. To look at him you could hardly
help laughing, and the laughter of the crowd at his daring dashes showed
that he was the privileged pet of everybody. Only at intervals the
downcast head was raised from its writing, and a quiet voice of warning
said:</p><p>與此同時，眼明手快的人群用愉快的嘲諷消磨了等待的乏味。一位濃眉大眼的人，手握酒瓶，走了過來，向低著頭的人表示恭敬和親近，然後爬上前排座位坐在司機旁邊，用他的深沉的嗓音開始模仿。他是人民的真正兒子，他的兇猛外表下，隱藏著一顆孩子的心。你看他，你會忍不住笑，群眾對他大膽的嘲諷的笑聲表明他是大家的寵兒。只有在間歇之間，那個低著頭的人才抬起頭來，一個平靜的警告聲音說：</p>
<p>"Bruno!"</p><p>布魯諾!</p>
<p>Then the shaggy head on the box-seat slewed round and bobbed downward
with an apologetic gesture, and ten seconds afterwards plunged into
wilder excesses.</p><p>然後，那個粗糙的頭在箱座上旋轉過來，並做出了歉意的動作，然後在十秒鐘後，他陷入了更狂烈的過度行為中。</p>
<p>"Pshaw!" mopping with one hand his forehead under his tipped-up
billicock, and holding the bottle with the other. "It's hot! Dog of a
Government, it's hot, I say! Never mind! here's to the exports of Italy,
brother; and may the Government be the first of them."</p><p>“呸！”他一手擦著翹起的船型帽下的前額，另一隻手拿著瓶子。“真熱！這個該死的政府，真的很熱，我說！不過沒關係！為了義大利的出口，乾杯，兄弟們；願政府是他們的先驅。”</p>
<p>"Bruno!"</p><p>布魯諾!</p>
<p>"Excuse me, sir; the tongue breaks no bones, sir! All Governments are
bad, and the worst Government is the best."</p><p>對不起，先生，舌頭並不會打斷骨頭，先生！所有政府都是壞的，而最壞的政府反而是最好的。</p>
<p>A feeble old man was at that moment crushing his way up to the cab.
Seeing him approach, David Rossi rose and held out his hand. The old man
took it, but did not speak.</p><p>那時，一位體弱的老人正在努力向出租車走去。見他接近，大衛·羅西起身並伸出手來。老人接過他的手，但並未說話。</p>
<p>"Did you wish to speak to me, father?"</p><p>您想跟我說話嗎，父親？</p>
<p>"I can't yet," said the old man, and his voice shook and his eyes were
moist.</p><p>"我還不能，"老人說，他的聲音在顫抖，眼睛潮濕。</p>
<p>David Rossi stepped out of the cab, and with gentle force, against many
protests, put the old man in his place.</p><p>大衛·羅西走出出租車，並以溫和的力量，儘管遭到多方反對，仍將老人安置在他的位置上。</p>
<p>"I come from Carrara, sir, and when I go home and tell them I've seen
David Rossi, and spoken to him, they won't believe me. 'He sees the
future clear,' they say, 'as an almanack made by God.'"</p><p>"先生，我來自卡拉拉，當我回家告訴他們我見過大衛·羅西並和他談過話時，他們不會相信我。他們說，'他看到的未來清晰如同由上帝製作的年鑑。'"</p>
<p>Just then there was a commotion in the crowd, an imperious voice cried,
"Clear out," and the next instant David Rossi, who was standing by the
step of his cab, was all but run down by a magnificent equipage with two
high-stepping<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00023" title="14"><a id="Page_14" title="14"></a></span> horses and a fat English coachman in livery of scarlet
and gold.</p><p>就在那時，人群中出現了一陣騷動，一個專橫的聲音大喊: "讓開"，下一刻，站在他的出租車旁邊的大衛·羅西，幾乎被一輛裝飾華麗，由兩匹高矮驕傲的馬以及一位身穿猩紅與金色制服的胖英格蘭車夫的豪華馬車撞倒。</p>
<p>His face darkened for a moment with some powerful emotion, then resumed
its kindly aspect, and he turned back to the old man without looking at
the occupant of the carriage.</p><p>他的臉孔一時被某種強烈的情緒籠罩，然後恢復了原本的和藹模樣，他轉過身來，對著老人，卻並未看向馬車裡的乘客。</p>
<p>It was a lady. She was tall, with a bold sweep of fulness in figure,
which was on a large scale of beauty. Her hair, which was abundant and
worn full over the forehead, was raven black and glossy, and it threw
off the sunshine that fell on her face. Her complexion had a golden
tint, and her eyes, which were violet, had a slight recklessness of
expression. Her carriage drew up at the entrance of the palace, and the
porter, with the silver-headed staff, came running and bowing to receive
her. She rose to her feet with a consciousness of many eyes upon her,
and with an unabashed glance she looked around on the crowd.</p><p>那是一位女士。她身材高大，擁有豐滿大方的體態，這種身材在美的尺度上可以說是宏大的。她的頭髮豐滿，而且披在額頭上，是烏黑而光澤的，當陽光落在她的臉上時，她的頭髮反射出陽光。她的膚色帶有金色的光澤，而她的眼睛是紫羅蘭色的，帶有一絲輕率的表情。她的馬車在宮殿的入口處停下，拿著銀頭手杖的門衛跑來鞠躬迎接她。當她感到許多雙眼睛注視著她時，她站起身來，毫不畏縮地環視著人群。</p>
<p>There was a sulky silence among the people, almost a sense of
antagonism, and if anybody had cheered there might have been a counter
demonstration. At the same time, there was a certain daring in that
marked brow and steadfast smile which seemed to say that if anybody had
hissed she would have stood her ground.</p><p>人群之間存在著一種悶悶不樂的寂靜，幾乎有種對抗的感覺，如果有人在此時歡呼，可能會引發反對的示威。與此同時，那張標誌性的額頭和堅定的微笑中帶有一種膽量，似乎在說如果有人對她噓聲，她會堅守自己的立場。</p>
<p>She lifted from the blue silk cushions of the carriage a small
half-clipped black poodle with a bow of blue ribbon on its forehead,
tucked it under her arm, stepped down to the street, and passed into the
courtyard, leaving an odour of ottar of roses behind her.</p><p>她從馬車上的藍絲絨墊子上抱起一隻小型的剪毛不足的黑色貴賓犬，狗的額頭上綁著一個藍絲帶，將它夾在手臂下，走下車來，進入庭院，留下一股玫瑰精油的香氣。</p>
<p>Only then did the people speak.</p><p>只有那時候人們才說話。</p>
<p>"Donna Roma!"</p><p>羅馬的女人！</p>
<p>The name seemed to pass over the crowd in a breathless whisper,
soundless, supernatural, like the flight of a bat in the dark.</p><p>這個名字似乎以一種無聲、超自然的低語，在人群中流傳，就像黑暗中蝙蝠的飛行。</p>
<h3 id="pgepubid00024">III</h3>
<p>The Baron Bonelli had invited certain of his friends to witness the
Pope's procession from the windows and balconies of his palace
overlooking the piazza, and they had begun to arrive as early as
half-past nine.</p><p>巴羅內利男爵已邀請部分的朋友們在他的宮殿內，從窗戶和陽臺觀賞教宗的遊行，這座宮殿正好俯瞰著廣場。他們甚至在早上九點半左右就開始抵達。</p>
<p>In the green courtyard they were received by the porter in the cocked
hat, on the dark stone staircase by lackeys in knee-breeches and yellow
stockings, in the outer hall, intended<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00025" title="15"><a id="Page_15" title="15"></a></span> for coats and hats, by more
lackeys in powdered wigs, and in the first reception-room, gorgeously
decorated in the yellow and gold of the middle ages, by Felice, in a
dress coat, the Baron's solemn personal servant, who said, in sepulchral
tones:</p><p>在綠色的庭院裡，他們被戴著三角帽的門房接待，而在深色的石階樓梯上則由穿著膝褲和黃色絲襪的僕人們迎接。在外廳，這裡用於放置外套和帽子，更多穿著傅粉假髮的僕人在此迎賓，在首個接待室，那裡華麗地裝飾著中古世紀的黃金色調，由斐利斯，穿著燕尾服，男爵的個人僕役，他以地底般的語調說道:</p>
<p>"The Baron's excuses, Excellency! Engaged in the Council-room with some
of the Ministers, but expects to be out presently. Sit in the Loggia,
Excellency?"</p><p>男爵的道歉，閣下！他正在與一些部長在議會室進行會議，但預計很快就會出來。閣下，要在走廊坐一坐嗎？</p>
<p>"So our host is holding a Cabinet Council, General?" said the English
Ambassador.</p><p>"所以我們的主人正在舉行內閣會議，將軍嗎？"英國大使說。</p>
<p>"A sort of scratch council, seemingly. Something that concerns the day's
doings, I guess, and is urgent and important."</p><p>類似於臨時會議的概念，我猜，可能是關於今天的事務，且迫切且重要的事情。</p>
<p>"A great man, General, if half one hears about him is true."</p><p>如果一半聽到的關於他的事情是真的，那他真是個偉大的人，將軍。</p>
<p>"Great?" said the American. "Yes, and no, Sir Evelyn, according as you
regard him. In the opinion of some of his followers the Baron Bonelli is
the greatest man in the country—greater than the King himself—and a
statesman too big for Italy. One of those commanding personages who
carry everything before them, so that when they speak even monarchs are
bound to obey. That's one view of his picture, Sir Evelyn."</p><p>“偉大？”美國人問道。“是也不是，伊芙琳爵士，這要看你如何看待他。在他的一些追隨者看來，邦內利男爵是這個國家最偉大的人，比國王本人還偉大，也是一個為義大利所不能容納的政治家。他是那種一出手就征服一切的人物，以至於當他說話時，甚至君主都必須聽命。這就是他的一種形象，伊芙琳爵士。”</p>
<p>"And the other view?"</p><p>而另一種觀黨呢？</p>
<p>General Potter glanced in the direction of a door hung with curtains,
from which there came at intervals the deadened drumming of voices, and
then he said:</p><p>波特將軍側目望向一扇掛有窗簾的門，從那裡間或傳來壓低了的說話聲，然後他說道：</p>
<p>"A man of implacable temper and imperious soul, an infidel of hard and
cynical spirit, a sceptic and a tyrant."</p><p>一個意志堅定、魂性高傲的男子，是一個冷酷、憤世嫉俗的異教徒，是一個懷疑論者和一個暴君。</p>
<p>"Which view do the people take?"</p><p>人們採取哪種觀點？</p>
<p>"Can you ask? The people hate him for the heavy burden of taxation with
which he is destroying the nation in his attempt to build it up."</p><p>你能問嗎？人們討厭他因為他以繁重的稅收負擔破壞國家，試圖建立起來。</p>
<p>"And the clergy, and the Court, and the aristocracy?"</p><p>而神職人員，法院和貴族呢？</p>
<p>"The clergy fear him, the Court detests him, and the Roman aristocracy
are rancorously hostile."</p><p>神職人員懼怕他，法院厭惡他，而羅馬貴族對他充滿惡意。</p>
<p>"Yet he rules them all, nevertheless?"</p><p>然而他仍然統治著他們所有人。</p>
<p>"Yes, sir, with a rod of iron—people, Court, princes, Parliament, King
as well—and seems to have only one unsatisfied desire, to break up the
last remaining rights of the Vatican and rule the old Pope himself."</p><p>"是的，先生，他用鐵杖統治——人民，法院，王子，議會，國王——似乎只有一個未滿足的願望，那就是剝奪梵蒂岡剩餘的所有權利，甚至統治老教皇本人。"</p>
<p>"And yet he invites us to sit in his Loggia and look at the Pope's
procession."<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00026" title="16"><a id="Page_16" title="16"></a></span></p><p>然而，他邀請我們坐在他的走廊上，觀看教皇的遊行。</p>
<p>"Perhaps because he intends it shall be the last we may ever see of it."</p><p>也許是因為他打算讓這成為我們可能見到的最後一次。</p>
<p>"The Princess Bellini and Don Camillo Murelli," said Felice's sepulchral
voice from the door.</p><p>"貝利尼公主和唐·卡米洛·穆雷利，"費利斯從門口帶著低沉如墓穴的聲音說道。</p>
<p>An elderly aristocratic beauty wearing nodding white plumes came in with
a pallid young Roman noble dressed in the English fashion.</p><p>一位佩戴著搖曳白色羽飾的高齡貴族美女，和一位穿著英國風格的蒼白年輕羅馬貴族一同進來。</p>
<p>"<i>You</i> come to church, Don Camillo?"</p><p>你來教堂了，唐·卡米洛嗎？</p>
<p>"Heard it was a service which happened only once in a hundred years,
dear General, and thought it mightn't be convenient to come next time,"
said the young Roman.</p><p>"聽說這是一種每百年才會發生一次的服務，親愛的將軍，我想下次可能不方便來，"年輕的羅馬人說。</p>
<p>"And you, Princess! Come now, confess, is it the perfume of the incense
which brings you to the Pope's procession, or the perfume of the
promenaders?"</p><p>而您，公主！現在來承認，是香火的香氣把您帶到教皇的遊行中，還是行人的香氣？</p>
<p>"Nonsense, General!" said the little woman, tapping the American with
the tip of her lorgnette. "Who comes to a ceremony like this to say her
prayers? Nobody whatever, and if the Holy Father himself were to
say...."</p><p>"胡說，將軍！"小個子女人說道，用她的長柄眼鏡尖輕輕打了打美國人。"誰會來這樣的儀式上禱告呢?根本無人，即使是教宗他自己要說...."</p>
<p>"Oh! oh!"</p><p>哦！哦！</p>
<p>"Which reminds me," said the little lady, "where is Donna Roma?"</p><p>"這讓我想起來，"小女士說，"唐娜·羅馬在哪裡呢?"</p>
<p>"Yes, indeed, where is Donna Roma?" said the young Roman.</p><p>"確實，羅馬的唐娜在哪裡呢？"這位年輕的羅馬人說。</p>
<p>"<i>Who</i> is Donna Roma?" said the Englishman.</p><p>"那位是唐娜·羅馬？"英國人說。</p>
<p>"Santo Dio! the man doesn't know Donna Roma!"</p><p>天哪！那個男人不認識唐娜·羅馬！</p>
<p>The white plumes bobbed up, the powdered face fell back, the little
twinkling eyes closed, and the company laughed and seated themselves in
the Loggia.</p><p>白色的羽毛簇撥起來，粉撲的臉孔後仰，小巧的眼睛閉上，眾人笑著安坐在走廊中。</p>
<p>"Donna Roma, dear sir," said the young Roman, "is a type of the fair
lady who has appeared in the history of every nation since the days of
Helen of Troy."</p><p>"羅馬的多娜，親愛的先生，"那位年輕的羅馬人說，"是一種自特洛伊的海倫時代以來在每個國家的歷史中出現的美女的象徵。"</p>
<p>"Has a woman of this type, then, identified herself with the story of
Rome at a moment like the present?" said the Englishman.</p><p>"那麼，這種型別的女人是否已在像現在這樣的時刻，將自己與羅馬的故事聯絡在一起呢?" 英國人說。</p>
<p>The young Roman smiled.</p><p>那位年輕的羅馬人微笑了。</p>
<p>"Why did the Prime Minister appoint so-and-so?—Donna Roma! Why did he
dismiss such-and-such?—Donna Roma! What feminine influence imposed upon
the nation this or that?—Donna Roma! Through whom come titles,
decorations, honours?—Donna Roma! Who pacifies intractable politicians
and makes them the devoted followers of the Ministers?—Donna Roma! Who
organises the great<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00027" title="17"><a id="Page_17" title="17"></a></span> charitable committees, collects funds and
distributes them?—Donna Roma! Always, always Donna Roma!"</p><p>為什麼總理會任命某某人呢？──唐娜·羅馬！ 他為何會免除某某人的職務？──唐娜·羅馬！ 是哪位女性的影響力讓這個或那個被強加於國家？──唐娜·羅馬！ 頭銜、獎勵、榮譽是透過誰來的？──唐娜·羅馬！ 誰能平撫棘手的政客並使他們成為部長們的忠實追隨者？──唐娜·羅馬！ 誰組織了大型的慈善委員會，收集經費並分發它們？──唐娜·羅馬！ 總是，總是唐娜·羅馬！</p>
<p>"So the day of the petticoat politician is not over in Italy yet?"</p><p>所以在義大利，女政客的時代還沒有結束嗎？</p>
<p>"Over? It will only end with the last trump. But dear Donna Roma is
hardly that. With her light play of grace and a whole artillery of love
in her lovely eyes, she only intoxicates a great capital and"—with a
glance towards the curtained door—"takes captive a great Minister."</p><p>"結束？只有在最後一張王牌出現時才會結束。但親愛的多娜·羅馬可不僅如此。憑藉著她的優雅輕盈與滿眼的愛意強烈炮擊，她不僅使整個首都著迷，"隨著目光朝向窗簾後的門-"還俘虜了一位偉大的部長。"</p>
<p>"Just that," and the white plumes bobbed up and down.</p><p>"僅此而已，"白色的羽毛上下簸動。</p>
<p>"Hence she defies conventions, and no one dares to question her actions
on her scene of gallantry."</p><p>因此，她挑戰傳統規範，且無人敢於質疑她在勇敢行為舞臺上的所作所為。</p>

threatens to buy an automobile."</p><p>每天下午在科索街駕駛一對純種馬，並威脅要購買一輛汽車。</p>

never known what it was to be poor."</p><p>欠債如山足以沉船，卻彷彿過著從未貧窮過的生活。</p>
<p>"And has she?"</p><p>她有嗎？</p>
<p>The voices from behind the curtained door were louder than usual at that
moment, and the young Roman drew his chair closer.</p><p>從帷幕門後面傳來的聲音在那一刻比平常大，年輕的羅馬人拉近了他的椅子。</p>
<p>"Donna Roma, dear sir, was the only child of Prince Volonna. Nobody
mentions him now, so speak of him in a whisper. The Volonnas were an old
papal family, holding office in the Pope's household, but the young
Prince of the house was a Liberal, and his youth was cast in the stormy
days of the middle of the century. As a son of the revolution he was
expelled from Rome for conspiracy against the papal Government, and when
the Pope went out and the King came in, he was still a republican,
conspiring against the reigning sovereign, and, as such, a rebel.
Meanwhile he had wandered over Europe, going from Geneva to Berlin, from
Berlin to Paris. Finally he took refuge in London, the home of all the
homeless, and there he was lost and forgotten. Some say he practised as
a doctor, passing under another name; others say that he spent his life
as a poor man in your Italian quarter of Soho, nursing rebellion among
the exiles from his own country. Only one thing is certain: late in life
he came back to Italy as a conspirator—enticed back, his friends
say—was arrested on a charge of attempted regicide, and deported to the
island of Elba without a word of public report or trial."</p><p>"多納羅馬，親愛的先生，是伏洛納王子的唯一的孩子。現在沒有人提起他，所以請小聲地談論他。伏洛納家是個古老的教皇家族，在教皇的家中擔任職務，但這家的年輕王子是一名自由主義者，他的青年時期處於世紀中葉的風暴日子裡。作為革命的兒子，他因陰謀反對教皇政府而被驅逐出羅馬，當教皇出走，國王進來時，他仍然是一個共和主義者，陰謀反對在位的君主，這樣的身分使他成為一名叛徒。在此期間，他遊走於歐洲各地，從日內瓦去到柏林，從柏林去到巴黎。最後他選擇在倫敦這個所有無家可歸者的歸宿處藏身，而在那裡，他被遺忘和失去了。有人說他以另一個名字當醫生；也有人說他在索霍的義大利區生活，像個窮人一樣，並且在那裡的他的同胞中間養成了反叛的性格。只有一件事情是肯定的：晚年時，他作為一個陰謀家回到了義大利——據他的朋友們說，是被引誘回來的——他因企圖篡位的指控而被捕，並被驅逐到厄爾巴島，公眾報告或審判的一個字都沒有。"</p>
<p>"Domicilio Coatto—a devilish and insane device," said the American
Ambassador.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00028" title="18"><a id="Page_18" title="18"></a></span></p><p>"強制住所——一種可惡且瘋狂的裝置,"美國大使說。</p>
<p>"Was that the fate of Prince Volonna?"</p><p>那是沃洛納王子的命運嗎？</p>
<p>"Just so," said the Roman. "But ten or twelve years after he disappeared
from the scene a beautiful girl was brought to Rome and presented as his
daughter."</p><p>"正如此,"羅馬人說。"但在他消失後的十或十二年中，有一個美麗的女孩被帶到羅馬並被宣稱是他的女兒。"</p>
<p>"Donna Roma?"</p><p>羅馬的女人？</p>
<p>"Yes. It turned out that the Baron was a kinsman of the refugee, and
going to London he discovered that the Prince had married an English
wife during the period of his exile, and left a friendless daughter. Out
of pity for a great name he undertook the guardianship of the girl, sent
her to school in France, finally brought her to Rome, and established
her in an apartment on the Trinità de' Monti, under the care of an old
aunt, poor as herself, and once a great coquette, but now a faded rose
which has long since seen its June."</p><p>是的。結果發現男爵與這個難民是親戚，他去了倫敦，發現王子在流亡期間娶了一位英國妻子，並留下了一個無依無靠的女兒。出於對大名的同情，他接任了女孩的監護人，將她送往法國上學，最終帶她來到羅馬，在特立尼塔山（Trinità de' Monti）的一個公寓裡安頓了她，由一位和她一樣窮困的老姨媽照顧。這位姨媽曾經是個大美女，但現在卻是一朵早已經度過盛夏的凋謝的玫瑰。</p>
<p>"And then?"</p><p>然後呢？</p>
<p>"Then? Ah, who shall say what then, dear friend? We can only judge by
what appears—Donna Roma's elegant figure, dressed in silk by the best
milliners Paris can provide, queening it over half the women of Rome."</p><p>那麼？啊，親愛的朋友，誰能說出那時候會發生什麼呢?我們只能根據眼前的情況來判斷——羅馬的唐娜·羅馬，她優雅的身影，穿著由巴黎最好的製帽商提供的絲衣，超越了羅馬一半的女人。</p>
<p>"And now her aunt is conveniently bedridden," said the little Princess,
"and she goes about alone like an Englishwoman; and to account for her
extravagance, while everybody knows her father's estate was confiscated,
she is by way of being a sculptor, and has set up a gorgeous studio,
full of nymphs and cupids and limbs."</p><p>"而現在，她的阿姨正好臥病在床，"小公主說，"她就像一個英國女人一樣獨自四處走動；為瞭解釋她的奢侈行為，儘管每個人都知道她父親的產業被沒收，她卻擺出一副雕塑家的架子，並建立了一個華麗的工作室，滿是仙女、丘位元和雕塑的腿部和手部。"</p>
<p>"And all by virtue of—what?" said the Englishman.</p><p>「全都是靠——什麼？」英國人說。</p>
<p>"By virtue of being—the good friend of the Baron Bonelli!"</p><p>"因為是巴羅尼·博內利的好朋友！"</p>
<p>"Meaning by that?"</p><p>那是什麼意思？</p>
<p>"Nothing—and everything!" said the Princess with another trill of
laughter.</p><p>"什麼都沒有——又什麼都有！"公主笑著再次尖叫起來。</p>
<p>"In Rome, dear friend," said Don Camillo, "a woman can do anything she
likes as long as she can keep people from talking about her."</p><p>"Don Camillo說道，「在羅馬，親愛的朋友，只要女人能保持別人不談論她，她就可以隨心所欲地做任何事情。」</p>
<p>"Oh, you never do that apparently," said the Englishman. "But why
doesn't the Baron make her a Baroness and have done with the danger?"</p><p>"哦，你顯然從不那樣做，"英國人說。 "但是為什麼男爵不讓她成為男爵夫人，然後就可以避免這個危險呢？"</p>
<p>"Because the Baron has a Baroness already."</p><p>因為男爵已經有了男爵夫人。</p>
<p>"A wife living?"</p><p>妻子還在生活？</p>
<p>"Living and yet dead—an imbecile, a maniac, twenty years a prisoner in
his castle in the Alban hills."<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00029" title="19"><a id="Page_19" title="19"></a></span></p><p>活著卻已死去——一個白痴，一個狂人，被困在阿爾巴尼山丘的城堡中二十年。</p>
<h3 id="pgepubid00030">IV</h3>
<p>The curtain parted over the inner doorway, and three gentlemen came out.
The first was a tall, spare man, about fifty years of age, with an
intellectual head, features cut clear and hard like granite, glittering
eyes under overhanging brows, black moustaches turned up at the ends,
and iron-grey hair cropped very short over a high forehead. It was the
Baron Bonelli.</p><p>窗簾從內門分開，三位先生走了出來。 第一位是一個高大瘦削的男子，大約五十歲，頭腦聰明，五官剛硬得如同花崗巖一般分明，眼睛靈動閃亮，眉毛濃鬱，黑色的鬍子兩端翹起，鐵灰色的頭髮在高額頭上剪得很短。他就是巴羅尼·博內利男爵。</p>
<p>One of the two men with him had a face which looked as if it had been
carved by a sword or an adze, good and honest but blunt and rugged; and
the other had a long, narrow head, like the head of a hen—a lanky
person with a certain mixture of arrogance and servility in his
expression.</p><p>在他身邊的兩個男人之一，臉龐看起來好像被劍或斧頭雕刻過，既良好又誠實，但直接且粗獷；另一個人頭部狹長，就像雞的頭一樣——一個瘠薄的人，在他的表情中帶著某種傲慢和卑躬屈膝的混合。</p>
<p>The company rose from their places in the Loggia, and there were
greetings and introductions.</p><p>該公司的成員從他們在走廊的位置站了起來，並進行了問候和介紹。</p>
<p>"Sir Evelyn Wise, gentlemen, the new British Ambassador—General Morra,
our Minister of War; Commendatore Angelelli, our Chief of Police. A
thousand apologies, ladies! A Minister of the Interior is one of the
human atoms that live from minute to minute and are always at the mercy
of events. You must excuse the Commendatore, gentlemen; he has urgent
duties outside."</p><p>“各位先生們，新任的英國大使——埃夫林·懷斯爵士。我們的戰爭部長——莫拉將軍；我們的警察局長——Angelelli閣下。諸位淑女，我實在抱歉！內政部長是一個活在每一分鐘裡、總是受制於時事的人。各位先生，你們必須原諒Angelelli閣下，他有緊急的外勤任務。”</p>
<p>The Prime Minister spoke with the lucidity and emphasis of a man
accustomed to command, and when Angelelli had bowed all round he crossed
with him to the door.</p><p>總理以習慣於指揮的清晰和強調的語氣講話，當安吉雷利四周鞠躬後，他與他一起走到門口。</p>
<p>"If there is any suspicion of commotion, arrest the ringleaders at once.
Let there be no trifling with disorder, by whomsoever begun. The first
to offend must be the first to be arrested, whether he wears cap or
cassock."</p><p>如果有任何騷亂的嫌疑，立即逮捕首要犯人。切勿對任何人起始的混亂掉以輕心。無論戴著帽子或僧袍，首先違反規定的人必須被首先逮捕。</p>
<p>"Good, your Excellency," and the Chief of Police went out.</p><p>"很好，閣下，"警察局長走了出去。</p>
<p>"Commotion! Disorder! Madonna mia!" cried the little Princess.</p><p>"騷亂！無秩序！我的瑪丹娜啊！"小公主喊道。</p>
<p>"Calm yourselves, ladies. It's nothing! Only it came to the knowledge of
the Government that the Pope's procession this morning might be made the
excuse for a disorderly demonstration, and of course order must not be
disturbed even under the pretext of liberty and religion."</p><p>請保持冷靜，各位女士。這沒有什麼！只是政府得知今早教皇的遊行可能被用作導致騷亂的藉口，當然，即使在自由和宗教的幌子下，秩序也不能被破壞。</p>
<p>"So that was the public business which deprived us of your society?"
said the Princess.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00031" title="20"><a id="Page_20" title="20"></a></span></p><p>"所以那就是公事，讓我們失去你的陪伴嗎？"公主說。</p>
<p>"And left my womanless house the duty of receiving you in my absence,"
said the Baron.</p><p>“伯爵說，我把接待你的責任留給了我的無人的房子，就在我不在的時候。”</p>
<p>The Baron bowed his guests to their seats, stood with his back to a wide
ingle, and began to sketch the Pope's career.</p><p>男爵向客人鞠躬引領他們坐下，然後背對著寬闊的壁爐，開始描繪教皇的生涯。</p>
<p>"His father was a Roman banker—lived in this house, indeed—and the
young Leone was brought up in the Jesuit schools and became a member of
the Noble Guard: handsome, accomplished, fond of society and social
admiration, a man of the world. This was a cause of disappointment to
his father, who has intended him for a great career in the Church. They
had their differences, and finally a mission was found for him and he
lived a year abroad. The death of the old banker brought him back to
Rome, and then, to the astonishment of society, he renounced the world
and took holy orders. Why he gave up his life of gallantry did not
appear...."</p><p>他的父親是一位羅馬銀行家，甚至曾在這棟房子里居住過。年輕的萊昂被送到耶穌會學校接受教育，後來成為了貴族衛隊的一員：英俊、有成就、喜歡社交和社會讚美，是一個世俗的男人。這使他的父親感到失望，原本他希望他能在教會有一番大事業。他們產生了分歧，最終為他找到了一個使命，他在國外生活了一年。老銀行家的去世讓他回到了羅馬，然後他出人意料地放棄了世俗生活，接受了聖職。他為何放棄了他的豪華生活，沒有人知道...</p>
<p>"Some affair of the heart, dear Baron," said the little Princess, with a
melting look.</p><p>"親愛的男爵，這是某種關於心事的事情，"小公主帶著一種溶化般的眼神說。</p>
<p>"No, there was no talk of that kind, Princess, and not a whisper of
scandal. Some said the young soldier had married in England, and lost
his wife there, but nobody knew for certain. There was less doubt about
his religious vocation, and when by help of his princely inheritance he
turned his mind to the difficult task of reforming vice and ministering
to the lowest aspects of misery in the slums of Rome, society said he
had turned Socialist. His popularity with the people was unbounded, but
in the midst of it all he begged to be removed to London. There he set
up the same enterprises, and tramped the streets in search of his waifs
and outcasts, night and day, year in, year out, as if driven on by a
consuming passion of pity for the lost and fallen. In the interests of
his health he was called back to Rome—and returned here a white-haired
man of forty."</p><p>"不，公主，沒有那種談話，也沒有絲毫的醜聞。有人說這個年輕計程車兵在英國結婚，並在那裡失去了他的妻子，但沒有人確切知道。對他的宗教職業的懷疑較小，當他用他的王子般的遺產轉向改革羅馬貧民窟的惡習和最低層的痛苦的困難任務時，社會說他變成了社會主義者。他在人民中的人氣無與倫比，但在其中，他請求被調往倫敦。在那裡，他開設了相同的企業，不分晝夜、年復一年地在街頭尋找他的流浪兒和流放者，彷彿被對失落和墮落者的深深同情所驅使。為了他的健康，他被召回羅馬-然後以一個四十歲的白髮男子的身份回到這裡。</p>
<p>"Ah! what did I say, dear Baron? The apple falls near the tree, you
know!"</p><p>啊！我說了什麼，親愛的男爵？蘋果總是落在樹的附近，你知道的！</p>
<p>"By this time he had given away millions, and the Pope wished to make
him President of his Academy of Noble Ecclesiastics, but he begged to be
excused. Then Apostolic Delegate to the United States, and he prayed
off. Then Nuncio to Spain, and he went on his knees to remain in the
Campagna Romana, and do the work of a simple priest among a simple
people. At last, without consulting him they made him Bishop, and
afterwards Cardinal, and, on the<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00032" title="21"><a id="Page_21" title="21"></a></span> death of the Pope, he was Scrutator to
the Conclave, and fainted when he read out his own name as that of
Sovereign Pontiff of the Church."</p><p>到了這個時候，他已經捐出了數百萬，教皇還想讓他成為他的貴族教士學院的主席，但他請求被免除這個職務。然後他被任命為美國的使徒代表，但他祈禱能夠逃脫。再然後，他被任命為西班牙的大使，他跪在地上請求留在羅馬的田野中，並在簡單的人民中做一名簡單的祭司的工作。最後，他們未經過他的同意，就任命他為主教，然後晉升為樞機主教，當教皇去世時，他被任命為宗主教密會的審查官，當他讀到自己名字作為教會的統治者時，他昏倒了。</p>
<p>The little Princess was wiping her eyes.</p><p>小公主正在擦拭她的眼睛。</p>
<p>"Then—all the world was changed. The priest of the future disappeared
in a Pope who was the incarnation of the past. Authority was now his
watchword. What was the highest authority on earth? The Holy See!
Therefore, the greatest thing for the world was the domination of the
Pope. If anybody should say that the power conferred by Christ on his
Vicar was only spiritual, let him be accursed! In Christ's name the Pope
was sovereign—supreme sovereign over the bodies and souls of
men—acknowledging no superior, holding the right to make and depose
kings, and claiming to be supreme judge over the consciences and crimes
of all—the peasant that tills the soil, and the prince that sits on the
throne!"</p><p>然後，整個世界都變了。未來的祭司消失在了一位是過去化身的教皇身上。權威成了他的口號。世界上最高的權威是什麼？是聖座！因此，教皇的統治才是世界上最重要的事。如果有人說基督賦予的權力僅僅是精神上的，願他被詛咒！以基督的名義，教皇是統治者-是對人們身體和靈魂的最高統治者-不認同任何上級，擁有立王倒王的權力，並宣稱是所有人-耕種土地的農民和坐在寶座上的王子-的良知和罪行的最終判決者！</p>
<p>"Tre-men-jous!" said the American.</p><p>"棒極了!"美國人說。</p>
<p>"But, dear Baron," said the little Princess, "don't you think there was
an affair of the heart after all?" and the little plumes bobbed
sideways.</p><p>"但是，親愛的男爵，"小公主說，"你不覺得這終究還是一樁心事嗎？"小羽毛們隨之扭曲擺動。</p>
<p>The Baron laughed again. "The Pope seems to have half of humanity on his
side already—he has the women apparently."</p><p>男爵再次大笑起來。“教皇似乎已經有一半的人類在他的支援下，他顯然已經得到了女性的擁護。”</p>
<p>All this time there had risen from the piazza into the room a humming
noise like the swarming of bees, but now a shrill voice came up from the
crowd with the sudden swish of a rocket.</p><p>這段時間裡，從廣場上升到房間裡的嗡嗡聲就像蜜蜂群起舞一樣，但現在有一種尖銳的聲音突然像火箭一樣從人群中傳上來。</p>
<p>"Look out!"</p><p>小心！</p>
<p>The young Roman, who had been looking over the balcony, turned his head
back and said:</p><p>那位站在陽臺上的年輕羅馬人轉過頭來說道：</p>
<p>"Donna Roma, Excellency."</p><p>"羅馬女士，閣下。"</p>
<p>But the Baron had gone from the room.</p><p>但男爵已經離開了房間。</p>
<p>"He knew her carriage wheels apparently," said Don Camillo, and the lips
of the little Princess closed tight as if from sudden pain.</p><p>“他似乎聽得出她的馬車輪子的聲音，”唐·卡米洛說。小公主的嘴唇瞬間緊閉，彷彿感受到了突如其來的痛苦。</p>
<h3 id="pgepubid00033">V</h3>
<p>The return of the Baron was announced by the faint rustle of a silk
under-skirt and a light yet decided step keeping pace with his own. He
came back with Donna Roma on his arm, and over his coolness and calm
dignity he looked pleased and proud.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00034" title="22"><a id="Page_22" title="22"></a></span></p><p>男爵的回歸由絲裙的微弱沙沙聲和與他的步伐保持一致的輕而確定的步伐宣告。他帶著唐娜·羅馬的手臂回來，在他的鎮定和莊重的尊嚴之上，他看起來很滿意並感到驕傲。</p>
<p>The lady herself was brilliantly animated and happy. A certain swing in
her graceful carriage gave an instant impression of perfect health, and
there was physical health also in the brightness of her eyes and the
gaiety of her expression. Her face was lighted up by a smile which
seemed to pervade her whole person and make it radiant with overflowing
joy. A vivacity which was at the same time dignified and spontaneous
appeared in every movement of her harmonious figure, and as she came
into the room there was a glow of health and happiness that filled the
air like the glow of sunlight through a veil of soft red gauze.</p><p>這位女士本人極為活力充沛和快樂。她優雅的舉止中有一種特定的節奏，立即給人留下完美健康的印象，她明亮的眼眸和歡快的表情中也充滿了身體健康的氣息。她的臉上燃燒著微笑，像是透過她整個人，讓她充滿了無盡的喜悅。她和諧的身姿中展現出的活力，同時體現出了尊嚴與自然，當她走進房間時，那種健康與快樂的氣息充滿了整個空氣，如同陽光透過柔和的紅色紗幕照亮了一切。</p>
<p>She saluted the Baron's guests with a smile that fascinated everybody.
There was a modified air of freedom about her, as of one who has a right
to make advances, a manner which captivates all women in a queen and all
men in a lovely woman.</p><p>她微笑著向男爵的客人們致意，這個微笑迷住了所有人。她身上有一種細微的自由氣息，就像一個有權利取悅他人的人，她的態度讓所有女人在女王身上，所有男人在美麗女人身上都被深深吸引。</p>
<p>"Ah, it is you, General Potter? And my dear General Morra? Camillo mio!"
(The Italian had rushed upon her and kissed her hand.) "Sir Evelyn Wise,
from England, isn't it? I'm half an Englishwoman myself, and I'm very
proud of it."</p><p>"啊，是你，波特將軍嗎？還有我親愛的莫拉將軍？我的卡米洛哦！"（這位義大利人衝上前來，吻了她的手。）"那位是來自英國的埃弗林·懷斯爵士，對吧？我自己有一半英國血統，我對此感到非常自豪。"</p>
<p>She had smiled frankly into Sir Evelyn's face, and he had smiled back
without knowing it. There was something contagious about her smile. The
rosy mouth with its pearly teeth seemed to smile of itself, and the
lovely eyes had their separate art of smiling. Her lips parted of
themselves, and then you felt your own lips parting.</p><p>她坦然地向伊芙林爵士微笑，他在不知不覺中回報了她的微笑。她的笑容有某種感染力。玫瑰色的嘴唇和珍珠般的牙齒似乎自行綻放出笑容，可愛的眼睛也有它們獨特的微笑藝術。她的嘴唇自然而然地張開，然後你會感覺到你自己的嘴唇也在開啟。</p>
<p>"You were to have been busy with your fountain to-day...." began the
Baron.</p><p>“您本應今天忙於您的噴泉……”男爵開始說。</p>
<p>"So I expected," she said in a voice that was soft yet full, "and I did
not think I should care to see any more spectacles in Rome, where the
people are going in procession all the year through—but what do you
think has brought me?"</p><p>"所以我有所期待，"她用柔和而飽滿的聲音說，"我認為我應該不想再看羅馬的任何奇觀，那裡的人們全年都在遊行之中，但你知道是什麼吸引我來的嗎?"</p>
<p>"The artist's instinct, of course," said Don Camillo.</p><p>"當然，是藝術家的直覺，" 唐卡米洛說。</p>
<p>"No, just the woman's—to see a man!"</p><p>"不，只有女人的—看到一個男人!"</p>
<p>"Lucky fellow, whoever he is!" said the American. "He'll see something
better than you will, though," and then the golden complexion gleamed up
at him under a smile like sunshine.</p><p>"真是個幸運的傢伙，不論他是誰！"美國人說。"他將會看到比你更美好的東西。"接著，一抹如陽光般的微笑在黃金般的面龐上掠過向他照耀。</p>
<p>"But who is he?" said the young Roman.</p><p>"但他是誰呢？”那位年輕的羅馬人問。</p>
<p>"I'll tell you. Bruno—you remember Bruno?"</p><p>我會告訴你。你還記得布魯諾嗎？</p>
<p>"Bruno!" cried the Baron.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00035" title="23"><a id="Page_23" title="23"></a></span></p><p>“布魯諾！”男爵大叫。</p>
<p>"Oh! Bruno is all right," she said, and, turning to the others, "Bruno
is my man in the studio—my marble pointer, you know. Bruno Rocco, and
nobody was ever so rightly named. A big, shaggy, good-natured bear,
always singing or growling or laughing, and as true as steel. A terrible
Liberal, though; a socialist, an anarchist, a nihilist, and everything
that's shocking."</p><p>"哦！布魯諾沒事的。" 她說，然後轉向其他人，"布魯諾是我工作室裡的助手──我的大理石指示員。他叫布魯諾·羅科，沒有人比他更適合這個名字。這位大個子、毛茸茸、善良的熊，總是在唱歌或者發牢騷，笑聲洪亮，忠誠如鋼。但他是個可怕的自由主義者，社會主義者，無政府主義者，虛無主義者，令人震驚的事物的代表。"</p>
<p>"Well?"</p><p>好嗎？</p>
<p>"Well, ever since I began my fountain ... I'm making a fountain for the
Municipality—it is to be erected in the new part of the Piazza Colonna.
I expect to finish it in a fortnight. You would like to see it? Yes?
I'll send you cards—a little private view, you know."</p><p>"自從我開始建造我的噴泉以來......我正在為市政府製作一座噴泉，將在Piazza Colonna的新部分豎立起來。
我預計兩周內完成，你想看嗎？是的？
我會寄給你門票 —— 你知道，這是一個小型的私人展覽。"</p>
<p>"But Bruno?"</p><p>但是布魯諾呢？</p>
<p>"Ah! yes, Bruno! Well, I've been at a loss for a model for one of my
figures ... figures all round the dish, you know. They represent the
Twelve Apostles, with Christ in the centre giving out the water of
life."</p><p>"啊！是的，Bruno！嗯，我一直在找不到一個模型對於我的雕像...你知道，雕像是環繞在盤子周圍的。他們代表的是十二使徒，而中間的基督正在分發生命之水。"</p>
<p>"But Bruno! Bruno! Bruno!"</p><p>但是布魯諾！布魯諾！布魯諾！</p>
<p>She laughed, and the merry ring of her laughter set them all laughing.</p><p>她笑了出來，她那快活的笑聲讓他們全都笑了起來。</p>
<p>"Well, Bruno has sung the praises of one of his friends until I'm
crazy ... crazy, that's English, isn't it? I told you I was half an
Englishwoman. American? Thanks, General! I'm 'just crazy' to get him
in."</p><p>"嗯，布魯諾對他的一位朋友讚不絕口，直到我快瘋了......瘋了，那是英語，對吧？我告訴過你我有一半是英國人。美國人？謝謝，將軍！我真的'瘋'得想讓他進來。"</p>
<p>"Simple enough—hire him to sit to you," said the Princess.</p><p>“簡單到可以——聘請他給你坐下來，"公主說。</p>
<p>"Oh," with a mock solemnity, "he is far too grand a person for that! A
member of Parliament, a leader of the Left, a prophet, a person with a
mission, and I daren't even dream of it. But this morning, Bruno tells
me, his friend, his idol, is to stop the Pope's procession, and present
a petition, so I thought I would kill two birds with one stone—see my
man and see the spectacle—and here I am to see them!"</p><p>"哦，"她帶著假正經的語氣說，"他是個遠比我想像的偉大人物！他是國會議員，左派的領導人，一位先知，一位擁有使命的人，我甚至不敢幻想他。但今天早上，布魯諾告訴我，他的朋友，他的偶像，將要阻止教皇的遊行，並遞交請願，所以我想一石二鳥——既看到我欣賞的人，也看到這壯觀的場面——所以我現在就在這裡等待他們！"</p>
<p>"And who is this paragon of yours, my dear?"</p><p>"我的親愛的，你所說的這個完美的人又是誰呢?"</p>
<p>"The great David Rossi!"</p><p>偉大的大衛·羅西！</p>
<p>"<i>That</i> man!"</p><p>那個男人！</p>
<p>The white plumes were going like a fan.</p><p>白色的羽毛像扇子般展開。</p>
<p>"The man is a public nuisance and ought to be put down by the police,"
said the little Princess, beating her foot on the floor.</p><p>"那個男人是公眾的滋擾，應該由警察來制止他，"小公主一邊說，一邊在地板上跺腳。</p>
<p>"He has a tongue like a sword and a pen like a dagger," said the young
Roman.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00036" title="24"><a id="Page_24" title="24"></a></span></p><p>"他的舌如利劍，筆如利鏢。"這位年輕的羅馬人說。</p>
<p>Donna Roma's eyes began to flash with a new expression.</p><p>唐娜·羅馬的眼中閃爍出新的表情。</p>
<p>"Ah, yes, he is a journalist, isn't he, and libels people in his paper?"</p><p>啊，對，他是個新聞記者，他不是在他的報紙上中傷人們嗎？</p>
<p>"The creature has ruined more reputations than anybody else in Europe,"
said the little Princess.</p><p>"那個生物毀掉的名譽比歐洲的任何人都多，"小公主說。</p>
<p>"I remember now. He made a terrible attack on our young old women and
our old young men. Declared they were meddling with everything—called
them a museum of mummies, and said they were symbolical of the ruin that
was coming on the country. Shameful, wasn't it? Nobody likes to be
talked about, especially in Rome, where it's the end of everything. But
what matter? The young man has perhaps learned freedom of speech in some
free country. We can afford to forgive him, can't we? And then he is so
interesting and so handsome!"</p><p>我現在想起來了。他對我們的年輕老太太和老年青年人進行了可怕的攻擊，宣稱他們幹預了所有事物 - 稱他們為木乃伊博物館，並說他們象徵著即將降臨國家的毀滅。真可恥，不是嗎？沒有人喜歡被人談論，尤其是在羅馬，那裡是一切的終結。但這有什麼關係呢？這個年輕人可能是在某個自由的國家學會了言論自由。我們可以原諒他，不是嗎？而且他是如此有趣，又如此帥氣！</p>
<p>"An attempt to stop the Pope's procession might end in tumult," said the
American General to the Italian General. "Was that the danger the Baron
spoke about?"</p><p>"嘗試阻止教皇的遊行可能會導致騷亂，"美國將軍對義大利將軍說。"那是男爵提到的危險嗎?"</p>
<p>"Yes," said General Morra. "The Government have been compelled to tax
bread, and of course that has been a signal for the enemies of the
national spirit to say that we are starving the people. This David Rossi
is the worst Roman in Rome. He opposed us in Parliament and lost.
Petitioned the King and lost again. Now he intends to petition the
Pope—with what hope, Heaven knows."</p><p>"是的，"莫拉將軍說。"政府被迫徵收麵包稅，這自然成為了國家精神的敵人聲稱我們正在餓死人民的訊號。這個大衛·羅西是羅馬最糟糕的人。他在議會中反對我們並且失敗了。向國王請願又再次失敗。現在他打算向教皇請願——這有什麼希望，天知道。"</p>
<p>"With the hope of playing on public opinion, of course," said the Baron
cynically.</p><p>"當然，是希望能夠影響公眾的意見，"男爵冷嘲熱諷地說。</p>
<p>"Public opinion is a great force, your Excellency," said the Englishman.</p><p>"公眾輿論是一種巨大的力量，閣下，"英國人說。</p>
<p>"A great pestilence," said the Baron warmly.</p><p>"一場大瘟疫，"男爵熱烈地說。</p>
<p>"What is David Rossi?"</p><p>“大衛·羅西是誰？”</p>
<p>"An anarchist, a republican, a nihilist, anything as old as the hills,
dear friend, only everything in a new way," said the young Roman.</p><p>"一個無政府主義者，一個共和主義者，一個虛無主義者，任何舊如山的東西，親愛的朋友，只是全部以新的方式，"年輕的羅馬人說。</p>
<p>"David Rossi is the politician who proposes to govern the world by the
precepts of the Lord's Prayer," said the American.</p><p>"大衛·羅西是那位提議按照主禱文的教誨來統治世界的政治家，"美國人說。</p>
<p>"The Lord's Prayer!"</p><p>主禱文！</p>
<p>The Baron paraded on the hearthrug. "David Rossi," he said
compassionately, "is a creature of his age. A man of generous impulses
and wide sympathies, moved to indignation at the extremes of poverty and
wealth, and carried away by the promptings of the eternal religion in
the human<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00037" title="25"><a id="Page_25" title="25"></a></span> soul. A dreamer, of course, a dreamer like the Holy Father
himself, only his dream is different, and neither could succeed without
destroying the other. In the millennium Rossi looks for, not only are
kings and princes to disappear, but popes and prelates as well."</p><p>男爵在壁爐地毯上炫耀走動，“大衛·羅西”，他憐憫地說，“是他這個時代的產物。一個充滿慷慨衝動和廣泛同情心的人，對於貧富兩極的憤慨，並受到人類靈魂中永恆宗教的驅使而感到激動。當然，他是一個夢想家，就像神聖的教皇本人一樣，只不過他的夢想與教皇不同，兩者都無法在摧毀對方的情況下成功。在羅西盼望的千禧年裡，國王和王子不僅要消失，教皇和主教也將消失。”</p>
<p>"And where does this unpractical politician come from?" said the
Englishman.</p><p>"這個不切實際的政客來自哪裡呢？"英國人說。</p>
<p>"We must ask you to tell us that, Sir Evelyn, for though he is supposed
to be a Roman, he seems to have lived most of his life in your country.
As silent as an owl and as inscrutable as a sphinx. Nobody in Rome knows
certainly who his father was, nobody knows certainly who his mother was.
Some say his father was an Englishman, some say a Jew, and some say his
mother was a gipsy. A self-centred man, who never talks about himself,
and cannot be got to lift the veil which surrounds his birth and early
life. Came back to Rome eight years ago, and made a vast noise by
propounding his platonic scheme of politics—was called up for his term
of military service, refused to serve, got himself imprisoned for six
months and came out a mighty hero—was returned to Parliament for no
fewer than three constituencies, sat for Rome, took his place on the
Extreme Left, and attacked every Minister and every measure which
favoured the interest of the army—encouraged the workmen not to pay
their taxes and the farmers not to pay their rents—and thus became the
leader of a noisy faction, and is now surrounded by the degenerate class
throughout Italy which dreams of reconstructing society by burying it
under ruins."</p><p>我們必須要你告訴我們這些，Evelyn 爵士，儘管他被認為是羅馬人，但他似乎大部分的生活都在你的國家度過。他像貓頭鷹一樣沉默，像斯芬克斯一樣高深莫測。在羅馬沒有人確切知道他的父親是誰，也沒有人確切知道他的母親是誰。有人說他的父親是英國人，有人說是猶太人，還有人說他的母親是吉普賽人。一個以自我為中心的男人，從不談論自己，也無法揭開他出生和早年生活的面紗。八年前回到羅馬，並以提出他的柏拉圖政治計劃而引起巨大的轟動 — 被召喚參加兵役，拒絕服役，因而被判處六個月的監禁，出獄後成了偉大的英雄 — 不僅代表一個選區進入議會，還有其他兩個，代表羅馬，並在極左派中取得了一席之地。他向每位部長和所有有利於軍隊利益的法案發起攻擊 — 鼓勵工人不要付稅，農民不要付租金 — 從而成為了一個吵鬧派別的領導者，現在被整個義大利的墮落階層所包圍，他們夢想透過將社會埋葬在廢墟下來重建社會。</p>
<p>"Lived in England, you say?"</p><p>你說你在英國住過嗎？</p>
<p>"Apparently, and if his early life could be traced it would probably be
found that he was brought up in an atmosphere of conspiracy—perhaps
under the influence of some vile revolutionary living in London under
the protection of your too liberal laws."</p><p>顯然，如果能追溯他的早年生活，可能會發現他是在陰謀的氛圍中長大的，也許是在某個惡名昭彰的革命者的影響下，在倫敦生活，並受到了你們過於寬鬆的法律的保護。</p>
<p>Donna Roma sprang up with a movement full of grace and energy. "Anyhow,"
she said, "he is young and good-looking and romantic and mysterious, and
I'm head over ears in love with him already."</p><p>唐娜·羅馬瀟灑地跳了起來，這種動作充滿了優雅和活力。"無論如何，"她說，"他還年輕，長得俊俏，富有浪漫風情而又神秘，我已經深深愛上他了。"</p>
<p>"Well, every man is a world," said the American.</p><p>"嗯，每個人都是一個世界，"美國人說。</p>
<p>"And what about woman?" said Roma.</p><p>“那女人呢？”羅馬說。</p>
<p>He threw up his hands, she smiled full into his face, and they laughed
together.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00038" title="26"><a id="Page_26" title="26"></a></span></p><p>他舉起雙手，她微笑著直視他的臉，他們一起笑了起來。</p>

<p>A fanfare of trumpets came from the piazza, and with a cry of delight
Roma ran into the balcony, followed by all the women and most of the
men.</p><p>自廣場上傳來一陣喇叭的奏樂聲，羅馬興奮地尖叫起來，跑上陽臺。所有的女人和大部分的男人都跟了上去。</p>
<p>"Only the signal that the cortège has started," said Don Camillo.
"They'll be some minutes still."</p><p>"只是訊號表明行列已經開始了，"唐·卡米洛說。
"他們還需要幾分鐘。"</p>
<p>"Santo Dio!" cried Roma. "What a sight! It dazzles me; it makes me
dizzy!"</p><p>"聖天哪！" 羅馬尖叫道。"這個景象！真是太炫目了，它讓我頭暈目眩！"</p>
<p>Her face beamed, her eyes danced, and she was all aglow from head to
foot. The American Ambassador stood behind her, and, as permitted by his
greater age, he tossed back the shuttlecock of her playful talk with
chaff and laughter.</p><p>她的臉孔煦煦發光，眼睛閃爍著興奮的光芒，從頭到腳透出一股喜氣。美國大使就站在她身後，憑藉他較高的年齡，他允許自己以玩笑和笑聲回應她的開心談話，如同把羽毛球一樣拋來拋去。</p>
<p>"How patient the people are! See the little groups on camp-stools
munching biscuits and reading the journals. 'La Vera Roma!'" (mimicking
the cry of the newspaper sellers). "Look at that pretty girl—the fair
one with the young man in the Homburg hat! She has climbed up the
obelisk, and is inviting him to sit on an inch and a half of corbel
beside her."</p><p>"人們是多麼的耐心啊！看看那些坐在露營凳上，咀嚼餅乾、閱讀報紙的小團體。'La Vera Roma！'（模仿報紙賣者的叫賣聲）。看那個漂亮的女孩-那個與帶著Homburg帽的年輕男子在一起的白皙女孩！她已經爬上了方尖碑，並邀請他在旁邊僅僅一寸半的凸出部分上坐下。"</p>
<p>"Ah, those who love take up little room!"</p><p>啊，那些愛人的人佔用的空間很少！</p>
<p>"Don't they? What a lovely world it is! I'll tell you what this makes me
think about—a wedding! Glorious morning, beautiful sunshine, flowers,
wreaths, bridesmaids ready; coachman all a posy, only waiting for the
bride!"</p><p>他們不是嗎？多麼可愛的世界啊！我想告訴你這使我想起了什麼——婚禮！美好的早晨，美麗的陽光，鮮花，花環，伴娘已經準備就緒；馬車伕全身裝飾得像一束花，唯一等待的就是新娘！</p>
<p>"A wedding is what you women are always dreaming about—you begin
dreaming about it in your cradles—it's in a woman's bones, I do
believe," said the American.</p><p>“一場婚禮就是你們女人們一直夢想的事情，你們從搖籃時期就開始夢想著它。我確實相信，這在一個女人的骨子裡。”這是美國人說的。</p>
<p>"Must be the ones she got from Adam, then," said Roma.</p><p>"那一定是她從亞當那裡得到的，" 羅馬說。</p>
<p>Meantime the Baron was still parading the hearthrug inside and listening
to the warnings of his Minister of War.</p><p>與此同時，男爵仍在室內的壁爐地毯上巡行，並聽取他的戰爭部長的警告。</p>
<p>"You are resolved to arrest the man?"</p><p>你決定要逮捕那個男人嗎？</p>
<p>"If he gives us an opportunity—yes."</p><p>如果他給我們一個機會－是的。</p>
<p>"You do not forget that he is a Deputy?"</p><p>你不要忘記他是副手嗎？</p>
<p>"It is because I remember it that my resolution is fixed. In Parliament
he is a privileged person; let him make half as much disorder outside
and you shall see where he will be."</p><p>這是因為我記得它，我的決心才會堅定。在議會裡，他是一個特權人物；讓他在外面製造一半的混亂，你就會看到他將會在哪裡。</p>
<p>"Anarchists!" said Roma. "That group below the balcony? Is David Rossi
among them? Yes? Which of them? Which? Which? Which? The tall man in the
black hat with his back to us? Oh! why doesn't he turn his face? Should
I shout?"<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00040" title="27"><a id="Page_27" title="27"></a></span></p><p>"無政府主義者！" 羅馬說。"那個在陽臺下面的團體？大衛·羅西在他們當中嗎？是嗎？哪一個？哪一個？哪一個？哪一個？背對我們的那個身材高大、戴著黑帽子的男人？哦！他為什麼不轉過臉來？我應該大喊嗎？"</p>
<p>"Roma!" from the little Princess.</p><p>"羅馬!"來自小公主。</p>
<p>"I know; I'll faint, and you'll catch me, and the Princess will cry
'Madonna mia!' and then he'll turn round and look up."</p><p>我知道，我會暈倒，你會抓住我，然後公主會哭喊'我的瑪丹娜啊!'然後他會轉過身來，抬頭看。</p>
<p>"My child!"</p><p>我的孩子！</p>
<p>"He'll see through you, though, and then where will you be?"</p><p>他會識破你，到時你該怎麼辦？</p>
<p>"See through me, indeed!" and she laughed the laugh a man loves to hear,
half-raillery, half-caress.</p><p>"透視我，真有你的!"她笑出了男人喜歡聽到的笑聲，半是嘲笑，半是愛撫。</p>
<p>"Donna Roma Volonna, daughter of a line of princes, making love to a
nameless nobody!"</p><p>"羅馬的唐娜·弗洛娜，出身王族世家的女兒，卻與一個無名小卒談起了戀愛！"</p>
<p>"Shows what a heavenly character she is, then! See how good I am at
throwing bouquets at myself?"</p><p>那就展示出她多麼是個天使般的性格了！看看我自我吹噓的能力有多強吧？</p>
<p>"Well, what is love, anyway? A certain boy and a certain girl agree to
go for a row in the same boat to the same place, and if they pull
together, what does it matter where they come from?"</p><p>那麼，愛情到底是什麼呢？一個特定的男孩和一個特定的女孩同意一起坐在同一艘船上，去同一個地方，如果他們齊心協力，那他們從哪裡來又有什麼關係呢？</p>
<p>"What, indeed?" she said, and a smile, partly serious, played about the
parted mouth.</p><p>"究竟是什麼呢？"她說，嘴角掛起了一絲微笑，既帶有一些稚氣，又帶著一些端莊。</p>
<p>"Could <i>you</i> think like that?"</p><p>你能這樣想嗎？</p>
<p>"I could! I could! I could!"</p><p>我能！我能！我能！</p>
<p>The clock struck eleven. Another fanfare of trumpets came from the
direction of the Vatican, and then the confused noises in the square
suddenly ceased and a broad "Ah!" passed over it, as of a vast living
creature taking breath.</p><p>鐘聲敲響了十一下。一陣喇叭聲再次從梵蒂岡的方向傳來，然後廣場上的困惑噪聲突然間停止了，一聲巨大的“啊！”回蕩在廣場上，就像一個巨大的生物在呼吸。</p>
<p>"They're coming!" cried Roma. "Baron, the cortège is coming."</p><p>「他們來了！」羅馬尖叫著。「男爵，行列正在來的路上。」</p>
<p>"Presently," the Baron answered from within.</p><p>“現在，”男爵從裡面回答。</p>
<p>Roma's dog, which had slept on a chair through the tumult, was awakened
by the lull and began to bark. She picked it up, tucked it under her arm
and ran back to the balcony, where she stood by the parapet, in full
view of the people below, with the young Roman on one side, the American
on the other, and the ladies seated around.</p><p>羅馬的狗在喧囂中睡在椅子上，被沉寂喚醒並開始吠叫。她把它抱起來，塞到她的手臂下，然後跑回陽臺，在欄杆旁站立，完全暴露在下面的人群視線之中，年輕的羅馬人在一邊，美國人在另一邊，而女士們則坐在周圍。</p>
<p>By this time the procession had begun to appear, issuing from a bronze
gate under the right arm of the colonnade, and passing down the channel
which had been kept open by the cordon of infantry.</p><p>此時遊行隊伍已開始出現，從柱廊右臂下的銅門進入，並沿著步兵封鎖線維持開放的通道前行。</p>
<p>Roma abandoned herself to the fascinations of the scene, and her gaiety
infected everybody.</p><p>羅馬完全沉浸在這迷人的場景中，她的歡樂感染了每一個人。</p>
<p>"Camillo, you must tell me who they all are. There now—those men who
come first in black and red?"</p><p>"卡米洛，你必須告訴我他們都是誰。現在看——那些走在前面的黑色和紅色的男人是誰？"</p>
<p>"Laymen," said the young Roman. "They're called the<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00041" title="28"><a id="Page_28" title="28"></a></span> Apostolic Cursori.
When a Cardinal is nominated they take him the news, and get two or
three thousand francs for their trouble."</p><p>"平信徒，"年輕的羅馬人說。 "他們被稱為使徒傳遞者。當一位樞機主教被提名時，他們會將這個訊息告訴他，並為他們的麻煩得到兩三千法郎。"</p>
<p>"And these little fat folk in white lace pinafores?"</p><p>"那些穿著白色蕾絲圍裙的小胖子呢?"</p>
<p>"Singers of the Sistine Chapel. That's the Director, old Maestro
Mustafa—used to be the greatest soprano of the century."</p><p>"西斯廷禮拜堂的歌手。那是指揮，老音樂大師穆斯塔法—他曾是這個世紀最偉大的女高音歌手。"</p>
<p>"And this dear old friar with the mittens and rosary and the comfortable
linsey-woolsey sort of face?"</p><p>"那位親愛的老修道士，手上帶著手套，掛著念珠，臉上帶著舒適的亞麻毛呢布般的表情？"</p>
<p>"That's Father Pifferi of San Lorenzo, confessor to the Pope. He knows
all the Pope's sins."</p><p>那是聖洛倫佐的皮菲裡神父，他是教宗的告解神父。他知道教宗所有的罪過。</p>
<p>"Oh!" said Roma.</p><p>「哦！」羅馬說。</p>
<p>At that moment her dog barked furiously, and the old friar looked up at
her, whereupon she smiled down on him, and then a half-smile played
about his good-natured face.</p><p>就在那一刻，她的狗狂吠起來，老修道士抬頭看向她，接著她微笑著看向他，然後他那滿面善良的臉孔露出半瞧不見的微笑。</p>
<p>"He is a Capuchin, and those Frati in different colours coming behind
him...."</p><p>他是一名卡普奇諾修道士，而跟在他後面的那些穿著不同顏色衣服的修道士們...</p>
<p>"I know them; see if I don't," she cried, as there passed under the
balcony a double file of friars and monks. "The brown ones—Capuchins
and Franciscans! Brown and white—Carmelites! Black—Augustinians and
Benedictines! Black with a white cross—Passionists! And the monks all
white are Trappists. I know the Trappists best, because I drive out to
Tre Fontane to buy eucalyptus and flirt with Father John."</p><p>"我認識他們，如果不信你看，"她大叫著，當街下的陽臺經過一隊兩排的僧侶和修道士。"那些棕色的 - 卡布奇諾和聖方濟各修會！棕色和白色的 - 迦密修會！黑色的 - 奧斯定會和本篤會！黑色帶白色十字架的 - 耶穌受難會！全白色的修道士是特拉比斯特會。我最熟悉的是特拉比斯特會，因為我常常駕車出去到特雷方塔託買尤加利和和約翰神父調情。"
</p>
<p>"Shocking!" said the American.</p><p>"震驚!"美國人說。</p>
<p>"Why not? What are their vows of celibacy but conspiracies against us
poor women? Nearly every man a woman wants is either mated or has sworn
off in some way. Oh, how I should love to meet one of those anchorites
in real life and make him fly!"</p><p>"為什麼不呢？他們的獨身誓言難道不是對我們這些可憐女人的陰謀嗎？幾乎每個女人想要的男人要麼已經成婚，要麼以某種方式發誓遠離。噢，我多想在現實生活中遇到一個這樣的隱修士，並使他飛翔！"</p>
<p>"Well, I dare say the whisk of a petticoat would be more frightening
than all his doctors of divinity."</p><p>"我敢肯定，一片裙襬的飄動都比他所有的神學博士更令人恐懼。"</p>
<p>"Listen!"</p><p>聽！</p>
<p>From a part of the procession which had passed the balcony there came
the sound of harmonious voices.</p><p>從已經經過陽臺的隊伍中傳來了和諧的聲音。</p>
<p>"The singers of the Sistine Chapel! They're singing a hymn."</p><p>西斯廷教堂的歌手！他們正在唱聖歌。</p>
<p>"I know it. '<i>Veni, Creator!</i>' How splendid! How glorious! I feel as if
I wanted to cry!"</p><p>我知道它。“來吧，創造者！”多麼壯麗！多麼光榮！我感覺好像想哭！</p>
<p>All at once the singing stopped, the murmuring and speaking of the crowd
ceased too, and there was a breathless moment, such as comes before the
first blast of a storm. A nervous<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00042" title="29"><a id="Page_29" title="29"></a></span> quiver, like the shudder that passes
over the earth at sundown, swept across the piazza, and the people stood
motionless, every neck stretched, and every eye turned in the direction
of the bronze gate, as if God were about to reveal Himself from the Holy
of Holies. Then in that grand silence there came the clear call of
silver trumpets, and at the next instant the Presence itself.</p><p>突然間，唱歌聲停止了，人群的低語和說話也停止了，然後是一個令人屏息的時刻，就像風暴的第一陣炮火前的寂靜。一種神經質的顫抖，如同日落時刻掠過地球的戰慄，席捲整個廣場，人們站立不動，每個人的脖子都伸長了，每隻眼睛都轉向銅門的方向，彷彿神即將從至聖所中顯示自己。然後在那寂靜的時刻，銀色的喇叭清晰地響起，下一刻，就是那神聖的存在其自身。</p>
<p>"The Pope! Baron, the Pope!"</p><p>教宗！男爵，教宗！</p>
<p>The atmosphere was charged with electricity. A great roar of cheering
went up from below like the roaring of surf, and it was followed by a
clapping of hands like the running of the sea off a shingly beach after
the boom of a tremendous breaker.</p><p>氣氛充滿了強烈的電能。一道強烈的歡呼聲從下方升起，就像海浪的咆哮，然後是一聲掌聲，就像巨大的海浪在沙灘上破掉後，海水在鵝卵石灘上流動的聲音。</p>
<p>An old man, dressed wholly in white, carried shoulder-high on a chair
glittering with purple and crimson, and having a canopy of silver and
gold above him. He wore a triple crown, which glistened in the sunlight,
and but for the delicate white hand which he upraised to bless the
people, he might have been mistaken for an image.</p><p>一名全身穿白色的老人，被高高扛在肩膀上的椅子上，椅子上繁星點點的紫色和深紅色閃爍著，上方有銀色和金色的天幕。他戴著在陽光下閃閃發光的三重冠冕，除了他挺起的劃過天際用來祝福人們的微白之手，他幾乎可以被誤認為是一尊雕像。</p>
<p>His face was beautiful, and had a ray of beatified light on it—a face
of marvellous sweetness and great spirituality.</p><p>他的面孔美麗，上面灑落著一道聖光——一張充滿了驚人的甜美和強烈精神性的臉。</p>
<p>It was a thrilling moment, and Roma's excitement was intense. "There he
is! All in white! He's on a gilded chair under the silken canopy! The
canopy is held up by prelates, and the chairmen are in knee-breeches and
red velvet. Look at the great waving plumes on either side!"</p><p>這是一個令人激動的時刻，羅馬的興奮感強烈無比。 “他在那裡！全身白色！他坐在絲質天篷下的鍍金椅子上！天篷由主教們支撐，而執事們則穿著膝褲和紅色絲絨。看看兩邊的大羽毛在飄揚著！”</p>
<p>"Peacock's feathers!" said a voice behind her, but she paid no heed.</p><p>"孔雀的羽毛!"一個聲音從她身後傳來，但她未予理會。</p>
<p>"Look at the acolytes swinging incense, and the golden cross coming
before! What thunders of applause—I can hardly hear myself speak. It's
like standing on a cliff while the sea below is running mountains high.
No, it's like no other sound on earth; it's human—fifty thousand
unloosed throats of men! That's the clapping of ladies—listen to the
weak applause of their white-gloved fingers. Now they're waving their
handkerchiefs. Look! Like the wings of ten thousand butterflies
fluttering up from a meadow."</p><p>看著侍祭手搖香爐，黃金十字架現身先前！何等的雷鳴般掌聲──我幾乎聽不見我自己的說話。這就像站在山崖邊，海浪在腳下翻滾，如山高。不，這並不像地球上的任何其他聲音；它是人類的聲音──五萬名釋放的男子的喉嚨！那是女士們的掌聲──聽聽他們白手套虛弱的鼓掌。現在他們正在揮舞著自己的手帕。看！像從草地上飛揚起來的萬只蝴蝶的翅膀。</p>
<p>Roma's abandonment was by this time complete; she was waving her
handkerchief and crying "<i>Viva il Papa Re!</i>"</p><p>到了這個時候，羅馬已經被完全遺棄了；她揮著手帕，哭喊著"萬歲，教宗國王！"</p>
<p>"They're bearing him slowly along. He's coming this way. Look at the
Noble Guard in their helmets and jackboots. And there are the Swiss
Guard in Joseph's coat of many colours! We can see him plainly now. Do
you smell<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00043" title="30"><a id="Page_30" title="30"></a></span> the incense? It's like the ribbon of Bruges. The pluviale?
That gold vestment? It's studded on his breast with precious stones. How
they blaze in the sunshine! He is blessing the people, and they are
falling on their knees before him."</p><p>他們正在緩緩地扶著他向前。他正朝這邊來。看看那些佩戴著頭盔，穿著長筒靴的皇家衛隊。現在又有瑞士衛隊穿著約瑟夫的彩色大衣！我們現在可以清楚地看到他。你聞到香氣了嗎？這就像布魯日的緞帶。那金色的法衣？就是他胸口鑲嵌著珍貴寶石的那一件。看它們在陽光下如何閃耀！他正在祝福人們，他們全都跪在他面前。</p>
<p>"Like the grass before the scythe!"</p><p>就像鐮刀前的草！</p>
<p>"How tired he looks! How white his face is! No, not white—ivory! No,
marble—Carrara marble! He might be Lazarus who was dead and has come
back from the tomb! No humanity left in him! A saint! An angel!"</p><p>他看起來多麼疲憊！他的臉色多麼蒼白！不，不是白色 - 是象牙色！不，是大理石 - 卡拉拉大理石！他可能就是從墳墓中回來的拉撒路！他已經沒有任何人性了！他是一位聖人！是一位天使！</p>
<p>"The spiritual autocrat of the world!"</p><p>世界的精神獨裁者！</p>
<p>"<i>Viva il Papa Re!</i> He's going by! <i>Viva il Papa Re!</i> He has
gone.... Well!"</p><p>萬歲教皇國王！他經過去了！萬歲教皇國王！他走了....很好！</p>
<p>She was rising from her knees and wiping her eyes, trying to cover up
with laughter the confusion of her rapture.</p><p>她正從膝蓋上站起來，擦拭眼淚，試圖用笑聲來掩蓋她狂喜的困惑。</p>
<p>"What is that?"</p><p>那是什麼？</p>
<p>There was a sound of voices in the distance chanting dolorously.</p><p>遠處傳來了悲慘誦唱的聲音。</p>
<p>"The cantors intoning <i>Tu es Petrus</i>," said Don Camillo.</p><p>"唱詩班正在吟唱《你是伯多祿》。"唐·卡米洛說。</p>
<p>"No, I mean the commotion down there. Somebody is pushing through the
Guard."</p><p>不，我是說下面的騷動。有人正在強行穿越警衛。</p>
<p>"It's David Rossi," said the American.</p><p>"是大衛·羅西,"美國人說。</p>
<p>"Is that David Rossi? Oh, dear me! I had forgotten all about him." She
moved forward to see his face. "Why ... where have I ... I've seen him
before somewhere."</p><p>那是大衛·羅西嗎？哎呀，我竟然全然忘記他了。她前移以便看清他的臉。“為什麼......我在哪裡......我好像在某處見過他。”</p>
<p>A strange physical sensation tingled all over her at that moment, and
she shuddered as if with sudden cold.</p><p>在那一刻，她全身感覺到一種奇異的生理刺激，好像突然間被寒冷撲面，讓她不禁打了個寒顫。</p>
<p>"What's amiss?"</p><p>發生了什麼問題？</p>
<p>"Nothing! But I like him. Do you know, I really like him."</p><p>沒什麼！但我喜歡他。你知道嗎，我真的很喜歡他。</p>
<p>"Women are funny things," said the American.</p><p>"女人真是有趣的生物，"美國人說。</p>
<p>"They're nice, though, aren't they?" And two rows of pearly teeth
between parted lips gleamed up at him with gay raillery.</p><p>"他們很好，不是嗎？"兩排如珍珠般的牙齒在微張的嘴唇間閃爍著，帶著愉快的戲謔向他露了出來。</p>
<p>Again she craned forward. "He is on his knees to the Pope! Now he'll
present the petition. No ... yes ... the brutes! They're dragging him
away! The procession is going on! Disgraceful!"</p><p>她再次探頭向前看。「他正在向教宗跪下！現在他要遞交的請願書。不…是的…那些野獸！他們正在將他拉走！遊行正在繼續！太丟臉了！」</p>
<p>"Long live the Workmen's Pope!" came up from the piazza, and under the
shrill shouts of the pilgrims were heard the monotonous voices of the
monks as they passed through the open doors of the Basilica intoning the
praises of God.</p><p>"萬歲工人教皇！"從廣場上響起，而在朝聖者的尖叫聲下，你能聽到修士們透過大教堂開放的門，以單調的聲音吟誦讚美上帝的詩歌。</p>
<p>"They're lifting him on to a car," said the American.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00044" title="31"><a id="Page_31" title="31"></a></span></p><p>"他們正在把他抬上汽車，"美國人說。</p>

is facing this way! Oh, yes; those are his own people with the banners!
Baron, the Holy Father has gone on to St. Peter's, and David Rossi is
going to speak."</p><p>多麼愉快！我們要聽他說話嗎？好的！我來得真高興！他正在朝這邊來！哦，對；那些舉著標語的都是他的人！男爵，教宗已經前往聖彼得，大衛·羅西將要發言。</p>
<p>"Hush!"</p><p>噓！</p>
<p>A quivering, vibrating voice came up from below, and in a moment there
was a dead silence.</p><p>一股顫抖、震動的聲音從下方傳來，瞬間，一切陷入了死寂。</p>

<p>"Brothers, when Christ Himself was on the earth going up to Jerusalem,
He rode on the colt of an ass, and the blind and the lame and the sick

to-day, brothers, but the Vicar of Christ goes on."</p><p>弟兄們，當基督親自在地上向耶路撒冷進發時，他騎在驢駒上，那些瞎眼的、跛腿的和病弱的人都來到他面前，他治癒了他們。今天的人類也病弱、盲目和跛腿，弟兄們，但基督的代理人仍在前進。</p>
<p>At the words an audible murmur came from the crowd, such as goes before
the clapping of hands in a Roman theatre, a great upheaval of the heart
of the audience to the actor who has touched and stirred it.</p><p>當這些話語出現時，人群中傳出了聽得見的喃喃聲，就像在羅馬劇院裡一陣掌聲之前的聲音，觀眾的心被觸動，像是一場大劇的觸動對於演員的回應。</p>
<p>"Brothers, in a little Eastern village a long time ago, there arose
among the poor and lowly a great Teacher, and the only prayer He taught
His followers was the prayer 'Our Father who art in Heaven.' It was the
expression of man's utmost need, the expression of man's utmost hope.
And not only did the Teacher teach that prayer—He lived according to
the light of it. All men were His brothers, all women His sisters; He
was poor, He had no home, no purse, and no second coat; when He was
smitten He did not smite back, and when He was unjustly accused He did
not defend Himself. Nineteen hundred years have passed since then,
brothers, and the Teacher who arose among the poor and lowly is now a
great Prophet. All the world knows and honours Him, and civilised
nations have built themselves upon the religion He founded. A great
Church calls itself by His name, and a mighty kingdom, known as
Christendom, owes allegiance to His faith. But what of His teaching? He
said: 'Resist not evil,' yet all Christian nations maintain standing
armies. He said: 'Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth,' yet
the wealthiest men are Christian men, and the richest<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00046" title="32"><a id="Page_32" title="32"></a></span> organisation in
the world is the Christian Church. He said: 'Our Father who art in
Heaven,' yet men who ought to be brothers are divided into states, and
hate each other as enemies. He said: 'Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done
on earth as it is done in Heaven,' yet he who believes it ever will come
is called a fanatic and a fool."</p><p>兄弟們，很久以前，在一個小東方村落中，出現了一位偉大的教師，他在貧窮和卑微之人中崛起，他所教導追隨者的唯一祈禱就是「我們在天上的父」。這是人類最迫切需要的表達，也是人類最大的希望。不僅教師教導這個禱告，他還根據它的指引來生活。所有男人都是他的兄弟，所有女人都是他的姐妹，他是貧窮的，沒有家，沒有錢，也沒有第二件外衣，他被打擊時他不反擊，被冤枉時他不自我辯護。自那時以來已經過去了一千九百年，兄弟們，那位在貧窮和卑微之人中崛起的教師現在是一位偉大的先知。全世界都認識並尊敬他，文明的國家都建立在他所建立的宗教之上。有一個偉大的教會自稱以他的名字命名，一個強大的王國，被稱為基督教世界，尊重他的信仰。但他的教誨呢？他說：「不要抵抗邪惡」，但所有的基督教國家都保持有常設軍隊。他說：「不要在地上積蓄財寶」，但最富有的人是基督教徒，世界上最富有的組織是基督教教會。他說：「我們在天上的父」，但本應當兄弟的人被分成各種國家，互相憎恨如敵人。他說：「願你的國度來臨，願你的旨意在地上如同在天上實現」，然而，相信它真的會來的人被稱為狂熱者和愚人。</p>
<p>Some murmurs of dissent were drowned in cries of "Go on!" "Speak!"
"Silence!"</p><p>一些反對的低語被“繼續！”“說話！”“安靜！”的大喊聲淹沒。</p>
<p>"Foremost and grandest of the teachings of Christ are two inseparable
truths—the fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man. But in Italy,
as elsewhere, the people are starved that king may contend with king,
and when we appeal to the Pope to protest in the name of the Prince of
Peace, he remembers his temporalities and passes on!"</p><p>基督教的教導中最重要也最偉大的兩個不可分割的真理是上帝的父性和人的兄弟情誼。然而，在義大利，就如在其他地方，為了讓國王與國王競爭，人民卻在飢餓中度日。當我們呼籲教皇以和平之王的名義提出抗議時，他卻記得他的短期利益並繼續前行！</p>
<p>At these words the emotion of the crowd broke into loud shouts of
approval, with which some groans were mingled.</p><p>在這些話語之後，群眾的情緒爆發成了熱烈的贊同喊叫，其中夾雜著一些呻吟聲。</p>
<p>Roma had turned her face aside from the speaker, and her profile was
changed—the gay, sprightly, airy, radiant look had given way to a
serious, almost a melancholy expression.</p><p>羅馬已經將臉轉向旁邊，不看講話人，她的側臉有了變化——那活潑、輕快、明朗、光芒四射的神情已經讓位給了一種嚴肅，幾乎可以說是憂鬱的表情。</p>
<p>"We have two sovereigns in Rome, brothers, a great State and a great
Church, with a perishing people. We have soldiers enough to kill us,
priests enough to tell us how to die, but no one to show us how to
live."</p><p>我們在羅馬有兩個君主，兄弟們，一個偉大的國家和一個偉大的教會，但人民卻在走向滅亡。我們有足夠計程車兵來殺我們，有足夠的神職人員告訴我們如何去死，但卻沒有人告訴我們如何去生活。</p>
<p>"Corruption! Corruption!"</p><p>貪汙！貪汙！</p>
<p>"Corruption indeed, brothers; and who is there among us to whom the
corruptions of our rulers are unknown? Who cannot point to the wars made
that should not have been made? to the banks broken that should not have
broken? And who in Rome cannot point to the Ministers who allow their
mistresses to meddle in public affairs and enrich themselves by the ruin
of all around?"</p><p>確實，兄弟們，我們中有誰不知道我們的統治者的腐敗行為呢？有誰不能指出那些本不應該發生的戰爭？有誰不能指出那些本不應該破產的銀行？而在羅馬有誰不能指出那些讓他們的情婦插手公共事務，並透過破壞周遭的一切來致富的部長們呢？</p>
<p>The little Princess on the balcony was twisting about.</p><p>陽臺上的小公主正在扭動身體。</p>
<p>"What! Are you deserting us, Roma?"</p><p>什麼！羅馬，你要背叛我們嗎？</p>
<p>And Roma answered from within the house, in a voice that sounded strange
and muffled:</p><p>羅馬從屋子裡回答，聲音聽起來奇怪且沉悶：</p>
<p>"It was cold on the balcony, I think."</p><p>我想陽臺上很冷。</p>
<p>The little Princess laughed a bitter laugh, and David Rossi heard it and
misunderstood it, and his nostrils quivered like the nostrils of a
horse, and when he spoke again his voice shook with passion.</p><p>小公主冷笑了一聲，大衛·羅西聽到了卻誤解了。他的鼻孔像馬的鼻孔一樣顫抖，當他再次開口時，他的聲音充滿了激情。</p>
<p>"Who has not seen the splendid equipages of these privileged ones of
fortune—their gorgeous liveries of scarlet and gold—emblems of the
acid which is eating into the public<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00047" title="33"><a id="Page_33" title="33"></a></span> organs? Has Providence raised this
country from the dead only to be dizzied in a whirlpool of scandal,
hypocrisy, and fraud—only to fall a prey to an infamous traffic without
a name between high officials of low desires and women whose reputations
are long since lost? It is men and women like these who destroy their
country for their own selfish ends. Very well, let them destroy her; but
before they do so, let them hear what one of her children says: The
Government you are building up on the whitened bones of the people shall
be overthrown—the King who countenances you, and the Pope who will not
condemn you, shall be overthrown, and then—and not till then—will the
nation be free."</p><p>誰沒有見過這些幸運者的華麗馬車——他們豪華的緋紅色和金色制服——公共機構中正在被侵蝕的酸的象徵？上帝是否僅僅為了讓這個國家在醜聞、偽善和欺詐的漩渦中暈頭轉向而從死亡中復甦——只是為了成為高階官員低俗慾望和早已聲譽狼藉的女人之間無名的惡名昭彰的交易的犧牲品？正是這些男人和女人為了自己的自私目的而摧毀他們的國家。好吧，讓他們毀掉她；但在他們這樣做之前，讓他們聽聽她的一個孩子的話：你們正在建立在人民白骨上的政府將被推翻——預設你們的國王和不會譴責你們的教皇將被推翻，然後——只有到那時——國家才能自由。</p>
<p>At this there was a terrific clamour. The square resounded with confused
voices. "Bravo!" "Dog!" "Dog's murderer!" "Traitor!" "Long live David
Rossi!" "Down with the Vampire!"</p><p>在此之後，場面轟然嘈雜。廣場上充滿了混亂的聲音。"好極了！" "狗！" "殺狗的人！" "叛徒！" "大衛羅西萬歲！" "打倒吸血鬼！"</p>
<p>The ladies had fled from the balcony back to the room with cries of
alarm. "There will be a riot." "The man is inciting the people to
rebellion!" "This house will be first to be attacked!"</p><p>那些女士們從陽臺驚慌地逃回了房間。"那會引發騷動的。""這個男人正在煽動人們起來造反！""我們的房子將會是首個遭到攻擊的！"</p>
<p>"Calm yourselves, ladies. No harm shall come to you," said the Baron,
and he rang the bell.</p><p>“安靜下來，女士們。不會有任何危險降臨在你們身上，”男爵說，然後他按了鈴。</p>
<p>There came from below a babel of shouts and screams.</p><p>從下方傳來一片吵雜的叫喊和尖叫聲。</p>
<p>"Madonna mia! What is that?" cried the Princess, wringing her hands; and
the American Ambassador, who had remained on the balcony, said:</p><p>"噢，我的天啊！那是什麼？”公主驚呼，雙手緊握；而一直待在陽臺上的美國大使說：</p>
<p>"The Carabineers have charged the crowd and arrested David Rossi."</p><p>騎兵隊衝向人群並逮捕了大衛·羅西。</p>
<p>"Thank God!"</p><p>感謝上帝！</p>
<p>"They're going through the Borgo," said Don Camillo, "and kicking and
cuffing and jostling and hustling all the way."</p><p>"他們正在穿過博戈，"唐卡米洛說，"一路上踢打、推搡和催趕。"</p>
<p>"Don't be alarmed! There's the Hospital of Santo Spirito round the
corner, and stations of the Red Cross Society everywhere," said the
Baron, and then Felice answered the bell.</p><p>"別害怕！聖斯皮裡託醫院就在附近，而且紅十字會的站點處處都有，"男爵說。接著，費利斯去應門。</p>
<p>"See our friends out by the street at the back, Felice. Good-bye,
ladies! Have no fear! The Government does not mean to blunt the weapons
it uses against the malefactors who insult the doctrines of the State."</p><p>"費利斯，去後街看看我們的朋友們。再見，女士們！ 不必擔心！政府不意圖對侮辱國家教義的罪犯使其武器變鈍。"</p>
<p>"Excellent Minister!" said the Princess. "Such canaglia are not fit to
have their liberty, and I would lock them all up in prison."<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00048" title="34"><a id="Page_34" title="34"></a></span></p><p>"出色的大臣！"公主說，"這種無賴根本不配享有自由，我要把他們全都關進監獄。"</p>
<p>And then Don Camillo offered his arm to the little lady with the white
plumes, and they came almost face to face with Roma, who was standing by
the door hung with curtains, fanning herself with her handkerchief, and
parting from the English Ambassador.</p><p>然後，唐·卡米洛向那位戴白色羽毛的小女士伸出了他的手臂，兩人走到幾乎和羅馬面對面的地方，羅馬正站在帶窗簾的門邊，用她的手帕扇風，正在與英國大使告別。</p>
<p>"Donna Roma," he was saying, "if I can ever be of use to you, either now
or in the future, I beg of you to command me."</p><p>"唐娜·羅馬，"他說，"如果我現在或將來能對你有所幫助，我請求你指示我。"</p>
<p>"Look at her!" whispered the Princess. "How agitated she is! A moment
ago she was finding it cold in the Loggia! I'm so happy!"</p><p>“看她！”公主低聲說。“她多麼激動啊！剛才在走廊裡她還覺得冷！我好開心！”</p>
<p>At the next instant she ran up to Roma and kissed her. "Poor child! How
sorry I am! You have my sympathy, my dear! But didn't I tell you the man
was a public nuisance, and ought to be put down by the police?"</p><p>下一刻她跑到羅馬身邊，親吻了她。「可憐的孩子！我多麼為你感到難過！你擁有我的同情，親愛的！但是我不是告訴過你那個男人是公眾之憾，應該被警察制止嗎？」</p>
<p>"Shameful, isn't it?" said Don Camillo. "Calumny is a little wind, but
it raises such a terrible tempest."</p><p>"真可恥，不是嗎?" 道恩·卡米洛說。 "誹謗就像微風，但卻能引起如此可怕的風暴。"</p>
<p>"Nobody likes to be talked about," said the Princess, "especially in
Rome, where it is the end of everything."</p><p>“沒有人喜歡被別人討論，”公主說，“尤其是在羅馬，這可是一切的終結。”</p>
<p>"But what matter? Perhaps the young man has learned freedom of speech in
a free country!" said Don Camillo.</p><p>"但這有何關係呢？也許這位年輕人在自由的國家裡學會了言論自由！"唐卡米洛說。</p>
<p>"And then he is so interesting and so handsome," said the Princess.</p><p>"然後他又如此有趣又帥氣,"公主說。</p>
<p>Roma made no answer. There was a slight drooping of the lovely eyes and
a trembling of the lips and nostrils. For a moment she stood absolutely
impassive, and then with a flash of disdain she flung round into the
inner room.</p><p>羅馬沒有回答。美麗的眼睛微微下垂，嘴唇和鼻孔微微顫抖。她站在那裡，完全無動於衷，然後用一種蔑視的閃光，她轉身走進內室。</p>
<h3 id="pgepubid00049">VIII</h3>
<p>Roma had taken refuge in the council-room. There had been much business
that morning, and a copy of the constitutional statute lay open on a
large table, which had a plate-glass top with photographs under the
surface.</p><p>羅馬已在議會室內找到避難所。那天早上有許多重要事務要辦，一份憲法的副本被展開在一張大桌子上，桌子頂部是鋼化玻璃，表面下面放著些照片。</p>
<p>In this passionless atmosphere, so little accustomed to such scenes,
Roma sat in her wounded pride and humiliation, with her head down, and
her beautiful white hands over her face.</p><p>在這種沒有激情的環境中，如此不習慣於這樣的情景，羅馬在她受傷的驕傲和羞辱中坐著，頭低下，美麗的白手覆蓋在她的臉上。</p>
<p>She heard measured footsteps approaching, and then a hand touched her on
the shoulder. She looked up and drew back as if the touch stung her. Her
lips closed sternly, and she got up and began to walk about the room,
and then she burst into a torrent of anger.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00050" title="35"><a id="Page_35" title="35"></a></span></p><p>她聽到有規律的腳步聲靠近，接著有隻手摸了摸她的肩膀。她抬頭看去，彷彿被觸控刺痛了似地向後退。她緊閉雙唇，站起來在房間裡走動，然後猛然間爆發出憤怒的情緒。</p>
<p>"Did you hear them? The cats! How they loved to claw me, and still purr
and purr! Before the sun is set the story will be all over Rome! It has
run off already on the hoofs of that woman's English horses. To-morrow
morning it will be in every newspaper in the kingdom. Olga and Lena and
every woman of them all who lives in a glass house will throw stones.
'The new Pompadour! Who is she?' Oh, I could die of vexation and shame!"</p><p>你有沒有聽到他們？那些貓！他們多麼喜歡用爪子抓我，還一直喵喵的叫！陽光還未落下，這個故事就已經傳遍了羅馬！那個女人的英國馬已經把它帶走了。明天早上，這將會出現在王國的每一份報紙上。奧爾加，萊納，以及所有生活在玻璃房子裡的女人都會拿起石頭砸我。「新的龐帕杜，她是誰？」哦，我真想因為煩惱和羞愧而死！</p>
<p>The Baron leaned against the table and listened, twisting the ends of
his moustache.</p><p>男爵靠在桌子上聆聽，扭動他鬍鬚的尖端。</p>
<p>"The Court will turn its back on me now. They only wanted a good excuse
to put their humiliations upon me. It's horrible! I can't bear it. I
won't. I tell you, I won't!"</p><p>法院現在會對我冷眼以對。他們只想找個藉口來羞辱我。這太可怕了！我受不了。我不會接受的。我告訴你，我不會接受這種事情！</p>
<p>But the lips, compressed with scorn, began to quiver visibly, and she
threw herself into a chair, took out her handkerchief, and hid her face
on the table.</p><p>但是她那充滿鄙視的嘴唇明顯開始顫抖，她扔到椅子上，拿出手帕，將臉埋在桌子上。</p>
<p>At that moment Felice came into the room to say that the Commendatore
Angelelli had returned and wished to speak with his Excellency.</p><p>就在那個時刻，費利斯走進房間說，安傑萊利commendatore已經回來，並且希望與他的閣下交談。</p>
<p>"I will see him presently," said the Baron, with an impassive
expression, and Felice went out silently, as one who had seen nothing.</p><p>"我將立刻去見他，"男爵面無表情地說，費麗絲默默地退了出去，好像她什麼都沒看見一樣。</p>
<p>The Baron's calm dignity was wounded. "Be so good as to have some regard
for me in the presence of my servants," he said. "I understand your
feelings, but you are much too excited to see things in their proper
light. You have been publicly insulted and degraded, but you must not
talk to me as if it were my fault."</p><p>男爵的冷靜尊嚴受到了傷害。“請你在我的僕人面前對我表示一些尊重。”他說：“我理解你的感受，但是你太激動了，無法正確看待事情。你已經被公開侮辱和貶低，但你不能好像這是我的錯一樣跟我說話。”</p>
<p>"Then whose is it? If it is not your fault, whose fault is it?" she
said, and the Baron thought her red eyes flashed up at him with an
expression of hate. He took the blow full in the face, but made no
reply, and his silence broke her answer.</p><p>"那麼是誰的錯？如果不是你的錯，那是誰的錯？"她說，男爵覺得她的紅瞳似乎帶著仇恨地閃爍在他身上。他不言反駁，默默地承受這一次攻擊，但他的沉默使她無法回答。</p>
<p>"No, no, that was too bad," she said, and she reached over to him, and
he kissed her and then sat down beside her and took her hand and held
it. At the next moment her brilliant eyes had filled with tears and her
head was down and the hot drops were falling on to the back of his hand.</p><p>"不，不，那實在太糟了，"她說著，並伸手過去觸碰他，他吻了她，然後坐到她身邊，握住她的手。下一刻，她那雙璀璨的眼睛充滿了淚水，頭也低下去了，熱辣辣的淚珠掉落在他的手背上。</p>
<p>"I suppose it is all over," she said.</p><p>"我想這一切都結束了，"她說。</p>
<p>"Don't say that," he answered. "We don't know what a day may bring
forth. Before long I may have it in my power to silence every slander
and justify you in the eyes of all."</p><p>"不要那麼說，"他回答道。"我們不知道每一天可能帶來什麼。不久的將來，我可能有能力將每一個誹謗聲束縛住，並且在所有人眼前為你證明清白。"</p>
<p>At that she raised her head with a smile and seemed to<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00051" title="36"><a id="Page_36" title="36"></a></span> look beyond the
Baron at something in the vague distance, while the glass top of the
table, which had been clouded by her breath, cleared gradually, and
revealed a large house almost hidden among trees. It was a photograph of
the Baron's castle in the Alban hills.</p><p>她抬起頭來，並帶著微笑，好像在看著男爵之外的模糊遠方。桌子的玻璃頂部，原本被她的呼吸弄雲了，漸漸地變得清晰起來，展現出一個大房子，幾乎被樹木所遮蔽。那是男爵在阿爾巴尼山的城堡的一張照片。</p>
<p>"Only," continued the Baron, "you must get rid of that man Bruno."</p><p>"只是,"男爵繼續說，"你必須擺脫那個名叫布魯諾的男人。"</p>
<p>"I will discharge him this very day—I will! I will! I will!"</p><p>我今天就會讓他出院—我會的！我會的！我會的！</p>
<p>There was an intense bitterness in the thought that what David Rossi had
said must have come of what her own servant told him—that Bruno had
watched her in her own house day by day, and that time after time the
two men had discussed her between them.</p><p>那種苦澀激烈到令人無法承受。那是出於大衛·羅西所說的話，肯定源於她的僕人告訴他的 - 布魯諾每天都在她自己的房子裡監視她，而且兩個男人無數次在她之間進行討論。</p>
<p>"I could kill him," she said.</p><p>"我可以殺了他，"她說。</p>
<p>"Bruno Rocco?"</p><p>布魯諾羅科</p>
<p>"No, David Rossi."</p><p>不，大衛·羅西。</p>
<p>"Have patience; he shall be punished," said the Baron.</p><p>"有耐心，他將被懲罰，"男爵說。</p>
<p>"How?"</p><p>如何？</p>
<p>"He shall be put on his trial."</p><p>他將被送上法庭受審。</p>
<p>"What for?"</p><p>為了什麼？</p>
<p>"Sedition. The law allows a man to say what he will about a Prime
Minister, but he must not foretell the overthrow of the King. The fellow
has gone too far at last. He shall go to Santo Stefano."</p><p>“煽動叛亂。法律允許人們任意評論首相，但卻不允許他預測國王的傾覆。這個傢伙終於過分了。他應該被送往聖斯特法諾。”</p>
<p>"What good will that do?"</p><p>那有什麼用？</p>
<p>"He will be silenced—and crushed."</p><p>他將被使沉默—並被壓垮。</p>
<p>She looked at the Baron with a sidelong smile, and something in her
heart, which she did not understand, made her laugh at him.</p><p>她斜眼笑著看著男爵，心中有種她自己也無法理解的情感，使她嘲笑他。</p>
<p>"Do you imagine you can crush a man like that by trying and condemning
him?" she said. "He has insulted and humiliated me, but I'm not silly
enough to deceive myself. Try him, condemn him, and he will be greater
in his prison than the King on his throne."</p><p>"你想你可以透過審判和定罪來壓倒像他那樣的男人嗎?"她說。"他侮辱和羞辱了我，但我並不傻到欺騙自己。試著審判他，定他的罪，他在獄中將比坐在王位上的國王更偉大。"</p>
<p>The Baron twisted the ends of his moustache again.</p><p>男爵再次擰動他的鬍鬚尖端。</p>
<p>"Besides," she said, "what benefit will it be to me if you put him on
trial for inciting the people to rebellion against the King? The public
will say it was for insulting yourself, and everybody will think he was
punished for telling the truth."</p><p>"除此之外，"她說，"如果你將他起訴煽動人民反抗國王，對我有什麼好處呢？公眾會說這是對你自己的侮辱，每個人都會認為他是因為說出真相而被懲罰。"</p>
<p>The Baron continued to twist the ends of his moustache.</p><p>男爵繼續扭動他的鬍鬚尖端。</p>
<p>"Benefit!" She laughed ironically. "It will be a<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00052" title="37"><a id="Page_37" title="37"></a></span> double injury. The
insult will be repeated in public again and again. First the advocate
for the crown will read it aloud, then the advocate for the defence will
quote it, and then it will be discussed and dissected and telegraphed
until everybody in court knows it by heart and all Europe has heard of
it."</p><p>「好處！」她諷刺地笑道，「這將是加倍的傷害。 侮辱將一再在公眾面前重複。首先，皇冠的辯護律師將大聲讀出來，然後辯護的辯護律師將引用它，然後它將被討論和解剖，並被電報傳送，直到法庭上的每個人都能背出來，全歐洲都聽說過它。」</p>
<p>The Baron made no answer, but watched the beautiful face, now very pale,
behind which conflicting thoughts seemed to wriggle like a knot of
vipers. Suddenly she leaped up with a spring.</p><p>男爵沒有回答，只是注視著那張現在已經非常蒼白的美麗面孔，似乎有衝突的思緒在其背後像一團蛇結一樣盤旋蠕動。突然，她像彈簧一樣跳了起來。</p>
<p>"I know!" she cried. "I know! I know! I know!"</p><p>「我知道！」她哭喊著。「我知道！我知道！我知道！」</p>
<p>"Well?"</p><p>那麼？</p>
<p>"Give the man to me, and I will show you how to escape from this
humiliating situation."</p><p>將那個男人交給我，我將告訴你如何逃脫這個羞辱的情況。</p>
<p>"Roma?" said the Baron, but he had read her thought already.</p><p>“羅馬？”男爵說，雖然他已經知道她的想法。</p>
<p>"If you punish him for this speech you will injure both of us and do no
good to the King."</p><p>如果你因為這段演講懲罰他，將會傷害我們倆，而且對國王也沒有任何好處。</p>
<p>"It's true."</p><p>這是真的。</p>
<p>"Take him in a serious conspiracy, and you will be doing us no harm and
the King some service."</p><p>讓他參與一場嚴重的陰謀，你對我們並無傷害，反而對國王有所助益。</p>
<p>"No doubt."</p><p>毫無疑問。</p>
<p>"You say there is a mystery about David Rossi, and you want to know who
he is, who his father was, and where he spent the years he was away from
Rome."</p><p>你說大衛·羅西有種神秘感，你想知道他是誰，他的父親是誰，他離開羅馬的這些年都在哪裡度過。</p>
<p>"I would certainly give a good deal to know."</p><p>我肯定會付出很多以求得知道。</p>
<p>"You want to know what vile refugee in London filled him with his
fancies, what conspiracies he is hatching, what secret societies he
belongs to, and, above all, what his plans and schemes are, and whether
he is in league with the Vatican."</p><p>"你想知道倫敦那個卑鄙的難民是如何使他充滿了幻想，他正在策劃什麼陰謀，他屬於什麼秘密組織，最重要的是，他的計劃和方案是什麼，以及他是否與梵蒂岡聯盟。"</p>
<p>She spoke so rapidly that the words sputtered out of her quivering lips.</p><p>她說話速度如此之快，以至於話語從她顫抖的嘴唇中噴湧而出。</p>
<p>"Well?"</p><p>好嗎？</p>
<p>"Well, I will find it all out for you."</p><p>好的，我將為你查明所有的事情。</p>
<p>"My dear Roma!"</p><p>我親愛的羅馬！</p>
<p>"Leave him to me, and within a month you shall know"—she laughed, a
little ashamed—"the inmost secrets of his soul."</p><p>"讓他交給我，一個月之內你就會知道"--她笑了，有點不好意思--"他靈魂的最深處的秘密。"</p>
<p>She was walking to and fro again, to prevent the Baron from looking into
her face, which was now red over its white, like a rose moon in a stormy
sky.</p><p>她再次來回走動，以防男爵看見她的臉。她的臉此刻因羞紅而變得如玫瑰月亮般，在暴風雨的天空中格外鮮明。</p>
<p>The Baron thought. "She is going to humble the man by her charms—to
draw him on and then fling him away,<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00053" title="38"><a id="Page_38" title="38"></a></span> and thus pay him back for what he
has done to-day. So much the better for me if I may stand by and do
nothing. A strong Minister should be unmoved by personal attacks. He
should appear to regard them with contempt."</p><p>男爵心想。"她將要用她的魅力使那個男人感到卑微──引誘他並隨後把他丟棄，以此來報復他今天所做的事情。如果我可以站在一旁，什麼也不做，對我來說那就更好了。一位強大的部長應該對個人攻擊保持冷靜。他應該表現出對他們的蔑視。"</p>
<p>He looked at her, and the brilliancy of her eyes set his heart on fire.
The terrible attraction of her face at that moment stirred in him the
only love he had for her. At the same time it awakened the first spasm
of jealousy.</p><p>他看著她，她眼中的璀璨光芒使他的心燃燒起來。那一刻，她臉上的魅力在他心中激起了對她的唯一愛戀。與此同時，它也喚醒了他首次的嫉妒之情。</p>
<p>"I understand you, Roma," he said. "You are splendid! You are
irresistible! But remember—the man is one of the incorruptible."</p><p>"我明白你，羅馬，"他說。 "你真了不起！你真無法抗拒！但是記住——那個男人是不可貪汙的。"</p>
<p>She laughed.</p><p>她笑了。</p>
<p>"No woman who has yet crossed his path seems to have touched him, and it
is the pride of all such men that no woman ever can."</p><p>到目前為止，似乎還沒有遇到過的女人能夠打動他，這也是所有這類男人的驕傲，認為沒有女人能與他們相提並論。</p>
<p>"I've seen him," she said.</p><p>"我見過他,"她說。</p>
<p>"Take care! As you say, he is young and handsome."</p><p>小心點！就像你說的，他年輕又帥氣。</p>
<p>She tossed her head and laughed again.</p><p>她甩了甩頭，再次笑了起來。</p>
<p>The Baron thought: "Certainly he has wounded her in a way no woman can
forgive."</p><p>男爵想：“他肯定已經以任何女人都無法原諒的方式傷害了她。”</p>
<p>"And what about Bruno?" he said.</p><p>「那麼布魯諾呢？」他說。</p>
<p>"He shall stay," she answered. "Such men are easy enough to manage."</p><p>"他將會留下來，"她回答道。"這種男人管理起來非常簡單。"</p>
<p>"You wish me to liberate David Rossi and leave you to deal with him?"</p><p>您希望我釋放大衛·羅西，並讓您來處理他？</p>
<p>"I do! Oh, for the day when I can turn the laugh against him as he has
turned the laugh against me! At the top of his hopes, at the height of
his ambitions, at the moment when he says to himself, 'It is done'—he
shall fall."</p><p>我當然願意！哦，期待那一天我能以其人之道還治其人之身，像他嘲笑我一樣反過來嘲笑他！在他希望的頂峰，他雄心壯志的巔峰，就在他對自己說“成功了”的那一刻——他將要倒下。</p>
<p>The Baron touched the bell. "Very well!" he said. "One can sometimes
catch more flies with a spoonful of honey than with a hogshead of
vinegar. We shall see."</p><p>男爵觸摸了鈴鐺。“很好！”他說，“有時候一勺蜜糖比一桶醋能夠更吸引更多的蒼蠅。我們拭目以待。”</p>
<p>A moment later the Chief of Police entered the room. "The Honourable
Rossi is safely lodged in prison," he said.</p><p>片刻之後，警察局長走進了房間。“尊敬的羅西已經安全地關押在監獄裡，”他說。</p>
<p>"Commendatore," said the Baron, pointing to the book lying open on the
table, "I have been looking again at the statute, and now I am satisfied
that a Deputy can be arrested by the authorisation of Parliament alone."</p><p>"男爵指著桌上敞開的書說道，「貴族，我再次查看了法條，現在我確信只有議會的授權才能逮捕副議長。」"</p>
<p>"But, Excellency, if he is taken in the act, according to the
forty-fifth article, the parliamentary immunity ceases."</p><p>"但是，閣下，如果他被當場抓到，根據第四十五條，議會的豁免權就會消失。"</p>
<p>"Commendatore, I have given you my opinion, and now it is my wish that
the Honourable David Rossi should be set at liberty."<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00054" title="39"><a id="Page_39" title="39"></a></span></p><p>指揮官，我已經給出了我的意見，現在，我希望尊敬的大衛·羅西可以被釋放。</p>
<p>"Excellency!"</p><p>閣下！</p>
<p>"Be so good as to liberate him instantly, and let your officers see him
safely through the streets to his home in the Piazza Navona."</p><p>請善待他，立即將他釋放，並讓你們的官員護送他安全地穿越街道，回到他在納沃納廣場的家中。</p>
<p>The little head like a hen's went down like a hatchet, and Commendatore
Angelelli backed out of the room.</p><p>像雞頭一樣的小腦袋像斧頭一樣下垂，安潔列利貴族倒退出房間。</p>

<p>The Piazza Navona is the heart and soul of old Rome. In other quarters
of the living city you feel tempted to ask: "Is this London?" or, "Is
this Paris?" or, "Is this New York or Berlin?" but in the Piazza Navona
you can only tell yourself, "This is Rome!"</p><p>納沃納廣場是古老羅馬的心臟和靈魂。在這個活躍的城市的其他區域，你可能會忍不住想問："這是倫敦嗎？"或者，"這是巴黎嗎？"或者，"這是紐約還是柏林嗎？"但在納沃納廣場，你只能告訴自己，"這就是羅馬！"</p>
<p>In an apartment-house of the Piazza Navona, David Rossi had lived during
the seven years since he became Member of Parliament for Rome. The
ground floor is a Trattoria, half eating-house and half wine-shop, with
rude frescoes on its distempered walls, representing the Bay of Naples
with Vesuvius in eruption. A passage running by the side of the
Trattoria leads to the apartments overhead, and at the foot of the
staircase there is a porter's lodge, a closet always lighted by a lamp,
which burns down the dark passage day and night, like a bloodshot eye.</p><p>在納沃納廣場的一棟公寓樓裡，大衛·羅西在成為羅馬國會議員的七年期間一直居住在這裡。一樓是一家Trattoria，一半是餐館，一半是酒吧，其泥灰色的牆壁上畫著粗糙的壁畫，描繪的是在維蘇威火山爆發的情況下的那不勒斯灣。一條走廊穿過Trattoria，通往樓上的公寓，樓梯下方有一個門衛的小屋，這間小屋裡總是有一盞燈在無論晝夜都燃燒著，就像一隻疲憊的紅眼睛，照亮著黑暗的走廊。</p>
<p>In this lodge lived a veteran Garibaldian, in his red shirt and pork-pie
hat, with his old wife, wrinkled like a turkey, and wearing a red
handkerchief over her head, fastened by a silver pin. David Rossi's
apartments consisted of three rooms on the fourth floor, two to the
front, the third to the back, and a lead flat opening out of them on to
the roof.</p><p>在這間小屋裡住著一位資深的加里波第戰士，他身穿紅色襯衫，戴著焗皮帽，與他老態龍鍾，像火雞一般皺紋紋的妻子，她頭上戴著一條紅色頭巾，用銀針固定。大衛·羅西的公寓位於四樓，有三個房間，兩個在前面，一個在後面，還有一個鉛平臺，從他們開出到屋頂。</p>
<p>In one of the front rooms on the afternoon of the Pope's Jubilee, a
young woman sat knitting with an open book on her lap, while a boy of
six knelt by her side, and pretended to learn his lesson. She was a
comely but timid creature, with liquid eyes and a soft voice, and he was
a shock-headed little giant, like the cub of a young lion.</p><p>在教皇銀禧紀念日的下午，一位年輕的女子坐在前屋中，膝頭放著一本開啟的書，正在編織。她身邊六歲的男孩跪著，假裝在學習他的功課。她是一個長相秀美但又膽怯的生物，眼睛溼潤，聲音柔和，而他，就像一隻年輕獅子的幼仔，頭髮蓬亂，猶如一個小巨人。</p>
<p>"Go on, Joseph," said the woman, pointing with her knitting-needle to
the line on the page. "'And it came to pass....'"</p><p>"繼續吧，約瑟夫，"那位女士邊說邊用她的編織針指著頁上的一行文字。"‘然後事情就這樣發生了......’"</p>
<p>But Joseph's little eyes were peering first at the clock on the
mantel-piece, and then out at the window and down the square.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00058" title="41"><a id="Page_41" title="41"></a></span></p><p>但是約瑟太太的小眼睛先是盯著壁爐臺上的鐘，然後又望向窗外和廣場下方。</p>
<p>"Didn't you say they were to be here at two, mamma?"</p><p>"媽媽，你不是說他們兩點要來嗎？"</p>
<p>"Yes, dear. Mr. Rossi was to be set free immediately, and papa, who ran
home with the good news, has gone back to fetch him."</p><p>是的，親愛的。 Rossi先生應立即被釋放，並且爸爸得知這個好訊息後就跑回家了，現在已經回去接他了。</p>
<p>"Oh! 'And it came to pass afterward that he loved a woman in the Valley
of Sorek, whose name was Delilah. And the lords of the Philistines came
unto her, and said unto her, Entice him and see wherein his great
strength lieth....' But, mamma...."</p><p>"哦！'隨後他在索瑞田穀愛上了一個名叫得利拉的女人。非利士的領袖們來到她那裡，對她說，勾引他，看看他的強大力量在哪裡......' 但是，媽媽...."</p>
<p>"Go on with your lesson, Joseph. 'And she made him sleep....'"</p><p>繼續你的課程，約瑟夫。'而她使他入睡....'</p>
<p>"'And she made him sleep upon her knees, and she called for a man, and
she caused him to shave off the seven locks of his head....'"</p><p>"她讓他在她的膝頭上睡著，然後叫來一個人，讓他剃掉他頭上的七縷頭髮...."</p>
<p>At that moment there came a knock at the door, whereupon the boy uttered
a cry of delight, and with a radiant face went plunging and shouting out
of the room.</p><p>就在那一刻，門外傳來了敲門聲，男孩於是高興地尖叫起來，然後滿臉燦爛的跑出房間，邊奔邊大喊。</p>
<p>"Uncle David! It's Uncle David!"</p><p>大衛叔叔！是大衛叔叔！</p>
<p>The tumultuous voice rolled like baby thunder through the apartment
until it reached the door, and then it dropped to a dead silence.</p><p>那洶湧的聲音如嬰兒般的雷聲在公寓內滾動，直到達到門口，然後陷入了死一般的寂靜。</p>
<p>"Who is it, Joseph?"</p><p>這是誰，約瑟夫？</p>
<p>"A gentleman," said the boy.</p><p>"一位紳士,"那男孩說。</p>
<h3 id="pgepubid00059">II</h3>
<p>It was the fashionable young Roman with the watchful eyes and twirled-up
moustache, who had stood by the old Frenchman's carriage in the Piazza
of St. Peter.</p><p>那是一位時尚的年輕羅馬人，他擁有警惕的雙眼和捲曲的鬍子，曾在聖彼得廣場站在那位老法國人的馬車旁。</p>
<p>"I wish to speak with Mr. Rossi. I bring him an important message from
abroad. He is coming along with the people, but to make sure of an
interview I hurried ahead. May I wait?"</p><p>我希望和羅西先生談話。我從國外帶給他一個重要的訊息。他正在隨著人群前來，但為了確保可以接見他，我提前快步趕來。我可以等待嗎？</p>
<p>"Certainly! Come in, sir! You say he is coming? Yes? Then he is free?"</p><p>當然！請進來，先生！你說他要來了？是的？那他自由了？</p>
<p>The woman's liquid eyes were glistening visibly, and the man's watchful
ones seemed to notice everything.</p><p>那位女子的水汪汪的眼睛明顯地閃爍著，而那男子警覺的眼神似乎能注意到一切。</p>
<p>"Yes, madam, he is free. I saw him arrested, and I also saw him set at
liberty."</p><p>是的，夫人，他已經自由了。我看到他被逮捕，也看到他被釋放。</p>
<p>"Really? Then you can tell me all about it? That's good! I have heard so
little of all that happened, and my<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00060" title="42"><a id="Page_42" title="42"></a></span> boy and I have not been able to
think of anything else. Sit down, sir!"</p><p>"真的嗎？那你可以告訴我所有的事情？這很好！我聽說的關於那件事的資訊很少，我和我的孩子被完全吸引住了。請坐下來，先生！"</p>
<p>"As the police were taking him to the station-house in the Borgo," said
the stranger, "the people made an attempt to rescue him, and it seemed
as if they must certainly have succeeded if it had not been for his own
intervention."</p><p>"當警察將他帶到博戈區的警察局時，"陌生人說，"人群試圖解救他，如果不是他自己介入，他們肯定會成功。"</p>
<p>"He stopped them, didn't he? I'm sure he stopped them!"</p><p>他阻止他們了，是嗎？我確定他阻止了他們！</p>
<p>"He did. The delegate had given his three warnings, and the Brigadier
was on the point of ordering his men to fire, when the prisoner threw up
his hands before the crowd."</p><p>他確實如此。代表已經給出了他的三個警告，而準將正要命令他的部下開火時，囚犯在人群前高舉起手。</p>
<p>"I knew it! Well?"</p><p>我就知道！那麼？</p>
<p>"'Brothers,' he said, 'let no blood be shed for my sake. We are in God's
hands. Go home!'"</p><p>"兄弟們，"他說，"為了我，不要流血。我們在上帝的手中。回家去！"</p>
<p>"How like him! And then, sir?"</p><p>多像他啊！然後呢，先生？</p>
<p>"Then the crowd broke up like a bubble, and the officer who was in
charge of him uncovered his head. 'Room for the Honourable Rossi!' he
cried, and the prisoner went into the prison."</p><p>然後，人群就像泡沫般散開了，而負責看管他的警官揭開了他的頭。他大喊道：“為可敬的羅西讓路！”然後，犯人走進了監獄。</p>
<p>The liquid eyes were running over by this time, and the soft voice was
trembling: "You say you saw him set at liberty?"</p><p>這時候，淚水已在液態的眼睛中溢位，柔和的聲音也在顫抖："你說你看到他被釋放了？"</p>
<p>"Yes! I was in the public service myself until lately, so they allowed
me to enter the police station, and when the order for release came I
was present and heard all. 'Deputy,' said the officer, 'I have the
honour to inform you that you are free.' 'But before I go I must say
something,' said the Deputy. 'My only orders are that you are to be set
at liberty,' said the officer. 'Nevertheless, I must see the Minister,'
said Mr. Rossi. But the crowd had pressed in and surrounded him, and in
a moment the flood had carried him out into the street, with shouts and
the waving of hats and a whirlwind of enthusiasm. And now he is being
drawn by force through the city in a mad, glad, wild procession."</p><p>"對！我自己直到最近也在公共服務部門工作，所以他們讓我進入了警察局，當釋放令來臨時，我在場並聽到了一切。「副議員」，那位軍官說，「我有幸通知你，你可以自由了。」「但在我走之前，我必須說些什麼，」副議員說。那位軍官說，「我的唯一指令就是你得被釋放。」「無論如何，我必須見部長，」羅西先生說。但是人群已經湧進來並包圍了他，一剎那間，群眾的狂熱就把他帶到了街上，所有人都在大呼小叫，揮舞著帽子，狂熱地圍繞著他。現在他被強迫地穿越城市，在一場瘋狂、欣喜、狂野的遊行中。"</p>
<p>"But he deserves it all, and more—far, far more!"</p><p>但他應得這一切，甚至更多，遠遠超出這些！</p>
<p>The stranger looked at the woman's beaming eyes, and said, "You are not
his wife—no?"</p><p>那個陌生人看著那位女士煥發的眼神，然後說：“你不是他的妻子吧？”</p>
<p>"Oh, no! I'm only the wife of one of his friends," she answered.</p><p>"哦，不！我只是他朋友的妻子，"她回答。</p>
<p>"But you live here?"</p><p>但你住在這裡嗎？</p>
<p>"We live in the rooms on the roof."<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00061" title="43"><a id="Page_43" title="43"></a></span></p><p>我們住在屋頂的房間裡。</p>
<p>"Perhaps you keep house for the Deputy?"</p><p>"或許你為副官管理家務?"</p>
<p>"Yes—that is to say—yes, we keep house for Mr. Rossi."</p><p>是的——也就是說——是的，我們為羅西先生打理房子。</p>
<p>At that moment the room, which had been gloomy, was suddenly lighted by
a shaft of sunshine, and there came from some unseen place a musical
noise like the rippling of waters in a fountain.</p><p>在那一刻，原本陰暗的房間突然被一道陽光照亮，而從某個看不見的地方傳來瞭如噴泉中水流潺潺的音樂般的聲音。</p>
<p>"It's the birds," said the woman, and she threw open a window that was
also a door and led to a flat roof on which some twenty or thirty
canaries were piping and shrilling their little swollen throats in a
gigantic bird-cage.</p><p>"是鳥兒們，" 女人說，她開啟了一個既是窗戶又是門的窗戶，通向一個平坦的屋頂。屋頂上有二十到三十隻金絲雀在一個巨大的鳥籠裡鳴叫，他們的小喉嚨鼓得滿滿的。</p>
<p>"Mr. Rossi's?"</p><p>羅西先生的？</p>
<p>"Yes, and he is fond of animals also—dogs and cats and rabbits and
squirrels, especially squirrels."</p><p>是的，他也很喜歡動物——如狗、貓、兔子和松鼠，尤其是松鼠。</p>
<p>"Squirrels?"</p><p>松鼠？</p>
<p>"He has a grey one in a cage on the roof now. But he is not like some
people who love animals—he loves children, too. He loves all children,
and as for Joseph...."</p><p>他現在在屋頂的籠子裡飼養了一隻灰色的。但他不像某些只愛動物的人，他也喜歡小孩子。他愛所有的孩子，至於約瑟夫....</p>
<p>"The little boy who cried 'Uncle David' at the door?"</p><p>在門口哭喊 '大衛叔叔' 的小男孩？</p>
<p>"Yes, sir. One day my husband said 'Uncle David' to Mr. Rossi, and he
has been Uncle David to my little Joseph ever since."</p><p>是的，先生。有一天，我丈夫對羅西先生說“大衛叔叔”，從那以後，我的小約瑟夫便一直叫他大衛叔叔。</p>
<p>"This is the dining-room, no doubt," said the stranger.</p><p>"這毫無疑問是餐廳," 那位陌生人說。</p>
<p>"Unfortunately, yes, sir."</p><p>不幸的是，是的，先生。</p>
<p>"Why unfortunately?"</p><p>為什麼不幸？</p>
<p>"Because here is the hall, and here is the table, and there's not even a
curtain between, and the moment the door is opened he is exposed to
everybody. People know it, too, and they take advantage. He would give
the chicken off his plate if he hadn't anything else. I have to scold
him a little sometimes—I can't help it. And as for father, he says he
has doubled his days in purgatory by the lies he tells, turning people
away."</p><p>因為這裡是大廳，這裡是餐桌，甚至連一個窗簾都沒有，一開門他就暴露在眾人面前。人們也知道，利用這一點。如果不是他沒有其他東西，他甚至會將盤子裡的雞肉給別人。我有時不得不小聲責備他一下——我沒辦法。至於父親，他說他在煉獄的時間已經加倍，因為他撒謊把人們拒之門外。</p>
<p>"That will be his bedroom, I suppose," said the stranger, indicating a
door which the boy had passed through.</p><p>"那將會是他的臥室，我想。"那位陌生人說，指著一扇男孩曾經走過的門。</p>
<p>"No, sir, his sitting-room. That is where he receives his colleagues in
Parliament, and his fellow-journalists, and his electors and printers
and so forth. Come in, sir."</p><p>"不，先生，那是他的會客室。那裡他接待他的議會同僚、他的新聞工作者同伴、他的選民、印刷商等等。請進，先生。"</p>
<p>The walls were covered with portraits of Mazzini, Garibaldi, Kossuth,
Lincoln, Washington, and Cromwell, and the room, which had been
furnished originally with chairs covered in chintz, was loaded with
incongruous furniture.</p><p>牆壁上掛著馬志尼、加里波第、科蘇特、林肯、華盛頓和克倫威爾的肖像畫，這個房間最初是用印花布蓋的椅子裝潢的，但現在卻堆滿了風格不協調的傢俱。</p>
<p>"Joseph, you've been naughty again! My little boy is all for being a
porter, sir. He has got the butt-end of his<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00062" title="44"><a id="Page_44" title="44"></a></span> father's fishing-rod, you
see, and torn his handkerchief into shreds to make a tassel for his
mace." Then with a sweep of the arm, "All presents, sir. He gets
presents from all parts of the world. The piano is from England, but
nobody plays, so it is never opened; the books are from Germany, and the
bronze is from France, but the strangest thing of all, sir, is this."</p><p>"約瑟夫，你又調皮了！我這個小男孩一心想當一個搬運工，先生。你看，他拿到了他父親釣魚竿的末端，並撕破他的手帕製作流蘇給他的權杖。"然後舉手向眾人一掃，“全都是禮物，先生。他從世界各地收到了禮物。鋼琴來自英國，但沒有人彈奏，所以從未開啟過；書籍來自德國，銅像來自法國，但最奇怪的事情在這裡，先生。"</p>
<p>"A phonograph?"</p><p>唱片機？</p>
<p>"It was most extraordinary. A week ago a cylinder came from the island
of Elba."</p><p>這實在非常不尋常。一個星期前，一個圓筒從厄爾巴島過來。</p>
<p>"Elba? From some prisoner, perhaps?"</p><p>"艾爾巴？可能是來自某位囚犯？"</p>
<p>"'A dying man's message,' Mr. Rossi called it. 'We must save up for an
instrument to reproduce it, Sister,' he said. But, look you, the very
next day the carriers brought the phonograph."</p><p>"「垂死者的資訊，」羅西先生稱它。'我們必須存錢來購買一臺能夠重現它的樂器，姐姐，'他說。但是你看，就在隔天送貨員就帶來了留聲機。"</p>
<p>"And then he reproduced the message?"</p><p>然後他重現了訊息嗎？</p>
<p>"I don't know—I never asked. He often turns on a cylinder to amuse the
boy, but I never knew him try that one. This is the bedroom, sir; you
may come in."</p><p>"我不知道—我從未問過。他常常為了逗樂那個男孩而開啟一個圓筒，但我從未知道他嘗試過那個。這裡是臥室，先生，您可以進來。"</p>
<p>It was a narrow room, very bright and lightsome, with its white
counterpane, white bed curtains, and white veil over the looking-glass
to keep it from the flies.</p><p>這是一間狹窄的房間，非常明亮而宜人，配有白色的床罩，白色的床帷，以及鏡子上的白色蓋子，用來防止蒼蠅。</p>
<p>"How sweet!" said the stranger.</p><p>"真甜!" 那陌生人說。</p>
<p>"It would be but for these," said the woman, and she pointed to the
other end of the room, where a desk stood between two windows, amid
heaps of unopened newspapers, which lay like fishes as they fall from
the herring net.</p><p>"這本來會是的，但因為這些，"女人說，她指著房間的另一端，那裡有一張書桌夾在兩扇窗戶之間，堆積的未開啟的報紙就像從鯡魚網中掉下來的魚一樣。</p>
<p>"I presume this is a present also?" said the stranger. He had taken from
the desk a dagger with a lapis-lazuli handle, and was trying its edge on
his finger-nail.</p><p>"我猜這也是禮物吧？"陌生人說。他從桌上拿起一把帶有青金石柄的匕首，並在指甲上試刀的鋒利度。</p>
<p>"Yes, sir, and he has turned it to account as a paper-knife. A
six-chamber revolver came yesterday, but he had no use for that, so he
threw it aside, and it lies under the newspapers."</p><p>是的，先生，他已將它用作開信刀。昨天來了一把六膛手槍，但他對此無用，所以他把它丟在一旁，現在就躺在報紙下面。</p>
<p>"And who is this?" said the stranger. He was looking at a faded picture
in an ebony frame which hung by the side of the bed. It was the portrait
of an old man with a beautiful forehead and a patriarchal face.</p><p>"這是誰呢？"陌生人問道。他正盯著床邊掛著的一幅掛在烏木框裡的褪色照片。那是一位老人的肖像，他有一個美麗的額頭和神聖的臉龐。</p>
<p>"Some friend of Mr. Rossi's in England, I think."</p><p>我想是羅西先生在英國的一位朋友。</p>
<p>"An English photograph, certainly, but the face seems to me Roman for
all that."</p><p>這絕對是一張英國的照片，但那張臉對我來說仍然顯得像羅馬人。</p>
<p>At that moment a thousand lusty voices burst on the air, as a great
crowd came pouring out of the narrow lanes into<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00063" title="45"><a id="Page_45" title="45"></a></span> the broad piazza. At
the same instant the boy shouted from the adjoining room, and another
voice that made the walls vibrate came from the direction of the door.</p><p>就在那一刻，數千個昂揚的聲音在空氣中迸裂，大群人從狹窄的巷子湧向寬闊的廣場。與此同時，男孩從旁邊的房間裡大喊，另一個足以讓牆壁震動的聲音從門的方向傳來。</p>
<p>"They're coming! It's my husband! Bruno!" said the woman, and the ripple
of her dress told the stranger she had gone.</p><p>"他們來了！是我丈夫！布魯諾！"女人說著，她的裙子的波紋告訴了陌生人她已經離去。</p>
<h3 id="pgepubid00064">III</h3>
<p>Laughing, crying, cheering, chaffing, singing, David Rossi's people had
brought him home in triumph, and now they were crowding upon him to kiss
his hand, the big-hearted, baby-headed, beloved children of Italy.</p><p>笑著、哭著、歡呼著、揶揄著、唱著，大衛·羅西的人民以凱旋的方式將他帶回了家，現在他們正擁向他，親吻他的手，這些熱情澎湃，心地善良，頭腦宛如孩童，深受愛戴的義大利之子們。</p>
<p>The object of this aurora of worship stood with his back to the table in
the dining-room, looking down and a little ashamed, while Bruno Rocco,
six feet three in his stockings, hoisted the boy on to his shoulder, and
shouted as from a tower to everybody as they entered by the door:</p><p>這位被敬拜光芒環繞的物件，背對著餐廳裡的桌子，低頭有些羞愧。布魯諾·羅科，身高六英尺三，他將男孩高高舉在肩上，像從塔上呼喊一樣，向每個進門的人大聲喊叫。</p>
<p>"Come in, sonny, come in! Don't stand there like the Pope between the
devil and the deep sea. Come in among the people," and Bruno's laughter
rocked through the room to where the crowd stood thick on the staircase.</p><p>"進來吧，小子，進來！別在那裡站立，像教皇夾在魔鬼和深海之間。來到人群中，"然後布魯諾的笑聲在房間中迴盪，一直傳到樓梯口密密麻麻的人群中。</p>
<p>"The Baron has had a lesson," said a man with a sheet of white paper in
his hand. "He dreamed of getting the Collar of the Annunziata out of
this."</p><p>"男爵已經上過一課了，"一個手裡拿著一張白紙的男人說。"他曾經夢想從此中獲得安農齊塔頸圈。"</p>
<p>"The pig dreamed of acorns," said Bruno.</p><p>"豬夢見了橡實，"布魯諾說。</p>
<p>"It's a lesson to the Church as well," said the man with the paper. "She
wouldn't have anything to do with us. 'I alone strike the hour of the
march,' says the Church."</p><p>"這也是對教會的一個教訓，"那位拿著檔案的男子說。"她不會和我們有任何關係。教會說，'只有我能敲響進軍的時刻。'"</p>
<p>"And then she stands still!" said Bruno.</p><p>「然後她就靜靜地站在那裡！」布魯諾說。</p>
<p>"The mountains stand still, but men are made to walk," said the man with
the paper, "and if the Pope doesn't advance with the people, the people
must advance without the Pope."</p><p>"山峰依然屹立，但人類卻註定要行走，"那位手握報紙的男士說道，“如果教皇不與人民一起進步，那人民就必須在沒有教皇的情況下前進。”</p>
<p>"The Pope's all right, sonny," said Bruno, "but what does he know about
the people? Only what his black-gowned beetles tell him!"</p><p>"教皇挺好的，小夥子"布魯諾說，"但他對人民瞭解多少呢？只是他那些身穿黑袍的甲殼獸告訴他的罷了！"</p>
<p>"The Pope has no wife and children," said the man with the paper.</p><p>"教宗沒有妻子和孩子," 紙上的人說。</p>
<p>"Old Vampire could find him a few," said Bruno, and then there was
general laughter.</p><p>"老吸血鬼可以找到他一些," 布魯諾說，然後大家都笑了起來。</p>
<p>"Brothers," said David Rossi, "let us be temperate. There's nothing to
be gained by playing battledore and shuttlecock<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00065" title="46"><a id="Page_46" title="46"></a></span> with the name of an old
man who has never done harm to any one. The Pope hasn't listened to us
to-day, but he is a saint all the same, and his life has been a lesson
in well-doing."</p><p>“兄弟們”，大衛·羅西說，“讓我們保持冷靜。對一個從未對任何人造成傷害的老人的名字來來去去施加攻擊是沒有任何好處的。教皇今天沒有聽取我們的觀點，但他依然是一位聖人，他的生活一直是一門行善的教課。”</p>
<p>"Anybody can sail with a fair wind, sir," said Bruno.</p><p>"任何人在順風時都可以開船，先生，"布魯諾說。</p>
<p>"Let us be prudent. There's no need for violence, whether of the hand or
of the tongue. You've found that out this morning. If you had rescued me
from the police, I should have been in prison again by this time, and
God knows what else might have happened. I'm proud of your patience and
forbearance; and now go home, boys, and God bless you."</p><p>讓我們謹慎行事。無論是肢體還是言語上的暴力，都無必要。你今早已經發現這一點。如果你們從警察那裡救了我，我現在可能又在獄中，而且天知道還可能發生什麼。我為你們的耐心和自我剋制感到驕傲；現在，孩子們，回家去吧，願上帝祝福你們。</p>
<p>"Stop a minute!" said the man with the paper. "Something to read before
we go. While the Carabineers kept Mr. Rossi in the Borgo, the Committee
of Direction met in a café and drew up a proclamation."</p><p>"等一下！"手上拿著報紙的男人說。 "在我們走之前有些東西要閱讀。而在佩騎兵將羅西先生留在博爾戈的同時，方向委員會在咖啡館裡開會並起草了一項宣言。"</p>
<p>"Read it, Luigi," said David Rossi, and the man opened his paper and
read:</p><p>"閱讀它，路易吉,"大衛·羅西說，然後那個男人開啟了他的檔案並開始讀：</p>
<p>"Having appealed in vain to Parliament and to the King against the
tyrannical tax which the Government has imposed upon bread in order that
the army and navy may be increased, and having appealed in vain to the
Pope to intercede with the civil authorities, and call back Italy to its
duty, it now behoves us, as a suffering and perishing people, to act on
our own behalf. Unless annulled by royal decree, the tax will come into
operation on the 1st of February. On that day let every Roman remain
indoors until an hour after Ave Maria. Let nobody buy so much as one
loaf of bread, and let no bread be eaten, except such as you give to
your children. Then, at the first hour of night, let us meet in the
Coliseum, tens of thousands of fasting people, of one mind and heart, to
determine what it is our duty to do next, that our bread may be sure and
our water may not fail."</p><p>經過無果的向國會和國王訴求，以反對政府為了增加陸軍和海軍而對麵包奉行的暴政稅收，並向教皇無果地求情，要求他與民政當局交涉，讓義大利回歸其應盡的責任。作為一個痛苦和垂死的人民，我們現在必須為自己採取行動。除非皇家法令將其取消，否則該稅將於二月一日生效。那天，讓每一個羅馬人在聖母瑪利亞課禱結束後的一小時內留在家裡。讓沒有一個人購買至少一個麵包，並且除了你給你的孩子的份，也不要吃任何麵包。然後，讓我們在一個晚上在羅馬競技場相見，我們是數以萬計的禁食人民，我們的思想與心意是相同的，以決定下一步我們有什麼義務要做，使我們的麵包能夠保證和我們的水不能斷裂。</p>
<p>"Good!" "Beautiful!" "Splendid!"</p><p>好的！美麗的！絕妙的！</p>
<p>"Only wants the signature of the president," said the reader, and Bruno
called for pen and ink.</p><p>"只需要總統的簽名，"讀者說，布魯諾則呼喚著要筆和墨水。</p>
<p>"Before I sign it," said Rossi, "let it be understood that none come
armed. There is nothing our enemies would like better than to fix on us
the names of rioters and rebels. We must defeat them. We must show the
world that we alone are the people of law and order. Therefore I call on
you to promise that none come armed."</p><p>"在我簽署之前，"羅西說，"讓我們明白一點，沒有人帶著武器來。沒有什麼比我們被賦予騷亂者和叛亂者的名字更能使我們的敵人高興的了。我們必須打敗他們。我們必須向世界證明，我們才是法律和秩序的維護者。因此，我呼籲你們保證，沒有人帶著武器來。”</p>
<p>"We promise," cried several voices.</p><p>「我們承諾！」幾個聲音大聲喊道。</p>
<p>"And now go home, boys, and God bless you."<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00066" title="47"><a id="Page_47" title="47"></a></span></p><p>現在回家吧，男孩們，願上帝保佑你們。</p>
<p>After a moment there was only one man left in the room. It was the
fashionable young Roman with the watchful eyes and twirled-up moustache.</p><p>片刻之後，房間裡只剩下一個人。那是一個時尚的年輕羅馬人，他有著警惕的眼睛和綿捲的鬍子。</p>
<p>"For you, sir!" said the young man, taking a letter from a pocket inside
his waistcoat.</p><p>"給您，先生！"年輕人說，從他的馬甲內口袋中拿出一封信。</p>
<p>David Rossi opened the letter and read: "The bearer of this, Charles
Minghelli, is one of ourselves. He has determined upon the
accomplishment of a great act, and wishes to see you with respect to
it."</p><p>大衛·羅西開啟了信，讀到：“此信的持有人，查理斯·明赫利，是我們自己人。他已經決定要完成一個偉大的行為，並希望就此與您見面。”</p>
<p>"You come from London?"</p><p>您來自倫敦嗎？</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."</p><p>是的，先生。</p>
<p>"You wish to speak to me?"</p><p>您想跟我說話嗎？</p>
<p>"I do."</p><p>我願意。</p>
<p>"You may speak freely."</p><p>您可以自由地說話。</p>
<p>The young man glanced in the direction of Bruno and of Bruno's wife, who
stood beside him.</p><p>那位年輕人朝布魯諾和站在他身旁的妻子的方向瞥了一眼。</p>
<p>"It is a delicate matter, sir," he said.</p><p>"這是一個敏感的問題，先生，"他說。</p>
<p>"Come this way," said David Rossi, and he took the stranger into his
bedroom.</p><p>"向這邊來，"大衛·羅西說，然後他帶著陌生人走進他的臥室。</p>
<h3 id="pgepubid00067">IV</h3>
<p>David Rossi took his seat at the desk between the windows, and made a
sign to the man to take a chair that stood near.</p><p>大衛·羅西在兩批窗戶間的書桌上坐下，並示意那個男子坐在附近的椅子上。</p>
<p>"Your name is Charles Minghelli?" said David Rossi.</p><p>“你的名字是查爾斯·明格利嗎？”大衛·羅西說。</p>
<p>"Yes. I have come to propose a dangerous enterprise."</p><p>是的。我來是為了提議一項危險的事業。</p>
<p>"What is it?"</p><p>這是什麼？</p>
<p>"That somebody on behalf of the people should take the law into his own
hands."</p><p>"應該有人代表人民，自行執行法律。"</p>
<p>The man had spoken with perfect calmness, and after a moment of silence
David Rossi replied as calmly:</p><p>那個男人以完美的冷靜說話了，經過一段沉默之後，大衛·羅西同樣冷靜地回答：</p>
<p>"I will ask you to explain what you mean."</p><p>我會請你解釋你的意思。</p>
<p>The man smiled, made a deferential gesture, and answered, "You will
permit me to speak plainly?"</p><p>那位男子微笑著，做出一個恭敬的手勢，並回答說："你可以允許我直言不諱嗎？"</p>
<p>"Certainly."</p><p>當然。</p>
<p>"Thanks! I have read your Creed and Charter. I have even signed my name
to it. It is beautiful as a theory—most beautiful! And the Republic of
Man is beautiful too. Beautiful!"</p><p>謝謝！我已經閱讀了你的信條和章程，甚至已經在上面簽上了我的名字。這理論實在是美，極其美麗！人的共和國也同樣美麗。真的非常美！</p>
<p>"Well?"</p><p>好吧？</p>
<p>"But more beautiful than practical, dear sir, and the<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00068" title="48"><a id="Page_48" title="48"></a></span> ideal thread that
runs through your plan will break the moment the rough world begins to
tug at it."</p><p>但是，尊敬的先生，美麗總是勝過實用，當粗糙的世界開始拉扯時，您計劃中的理想主線將會瞬間斷裂。</p>
<p>"I will ask you to be more precise," said David Rossi.</p><p>"我會請你更加精確一些。"羅西大衛說。</p>
<p>"With pleasure. You have called a meeting in the Coliseum to protest
against the bread-tax. What if the Government prohibits it? Your
principle of passive resistance will not permit you to rebel, and
without the right of public meeting your association is powerless. Then
where are you?"</p><p>樂意為您服務。您已在羅馬競技場召集了一場抗議麵包稅的會議。如果政府禁止此事，該怎麼辦？您的被動抵抗原則將不允許您反叛，而沒有公開集會的權利，您的協會就毫無力量。那麼，您將處於何種地位呢？</p>
<p>David Rossi had taken up his paper-knife dagger and was drawing lines
with the point of it on the letter of introduction which now lay open on
the desk. The man saw the impression he had produced, and went on with
more vigour.</p><p>大衛·羅西拿起他的紙刀匕首，用尖端在現在擺在桌上的介紹信上畫線。那人看到他產生的印象，並以更大的力氣繼續前進。</p>
<p>"If the Governments of the world deny you the right of meeting, where
are your weapons of warfare? On the one side armies on armies of men
marshalled and equipped with all the arts and engines of war; on the
other side a helpless multitude with their hands in their pockets, or
paying a penny a week subscription to the great association that is to
overcome by passive suffering the power of the combined treasuries of
the world!"</p><p>"如果世界各國的政府否認你集會的權利，你的戰爭武器在哪裡？一方面是隊伍整齊、裝備完善並擁有所有戰爭技術和武器的軍隊；另一方面是一群無助的大眾，他們把手插在口袋裡，或者每週支付一便士給那個大組織，該組織旨在透過被動的痛苦來克服世界聯合財政庫的力量！"</p>
<p>David Rossi had risen from his seat, and was walking backward and
forward with a step that was long and slow.</p><p>大衛·羅西已經從座位上站起來，並且以長而慢的步伐來回走動。</p>
<p>"Well, and what do <i>you</i> say we ought to do?" he said.</p><p>「那麼，你認為我們應該做什麼？」他說。</p>
<p>A flash came from the man's eyes, and he said in a thick voice:</p><p>閃光從那個男人的眼中射出，他用沉重的聲音說道：</p>
<p>"Remove the one man in Rome whose hand crushes the nation."</p><p>移除在羅馬那個壓垮國家的男人。</p>
<p>"The Prime Minister?"</p><p>總理？</p>
<p>"Yes."</p><p>是</p>
<p>There was silence.</p><p>那裡一片寂靜。</p>
<p>"You expect me to do that?"</p><p>你期待我做那件事？</p>
<p>"No! I will do it for you.... Why not? If violence is wrong, it is right
to resist violence."</p><p>不！我會為你做這件事.... 為什麼不呢？如果暴力是錯的，那麼抵抗暴力就是對的。</p>
<p>David Rossi returned to his seat at the desk, touched the letter of
introduction, and said:</p><p>大衛·羅西返回到他的辦公桌座位，觸摸了介紹信，然後說：</p>
<p>"That is the great act referred to in this letter from London?"</p><p>那是在這封來自倫敦的信中提到的偉大行為嗎？</p>
<p>"Yes."</p><p>是</p>
<p>"Why do you come to me?" he said.</p><p>「你為何來找我？」他說。</p>
<p>"Because you can help me to accomplish this act. You are a Member of
Parliament, and can give me cards to the<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00069" title="49"><a id="Page_49" title="49"></a></span> Chamber. You can show me the
way to the Prime Minister's room in Monte Citorio, and tell me the
moment when he is to be found alone."</p><p>因為你可以幫助我完成這件事。你是一名議會成員，可以給我議會的門票。你可以告訴我在蒙特奇多里奧如何找到首相的房間，並告訴我何時可以獨自找到他。</p>
<p>"I do not deny that the Prime Minister deserves death."</p><p>我並不否認首相應得到死刑。</p>
<p>"A thousand deaths, sir, and everybody would hail them with delight."</p><p>"先生，一千次的死亡，每個人都會歡欣鼓舞地迎接它們。"</p>
<p>"I do not deny that his death would be a relief to the people."</p><p>我不否認他的死對人民來說會是一種解脫。</p>
<p>"On the day he dies, sir, the people will live."</p><p>當他去世的那天，先生，人們將會生活。</p>
<p>"Or that crimes—great crimes—have been the means of bringing about
great reforms."</p><p>或者那些罪行——重大的罪行——已經成為推動重大改革的手段。</p>
<p>"You are right, sir—but it would be no crime."</p><p>您說得對，先生——但那並非罪行。</p>
<p>The stranger's face flushed up, his eyes seemed to burn, and he leaned
over to the desk and took up the dagger.</p><p>陌生人的臉色一下子紅了起來，他的眼睛似乎在燃燒，他向前靠過去，伸手拿起了那把匕首。</p>
<p>"See! Give me this! It's exactly what I want. I'll put it in a bouquet
of flowers, and pretend to offer them. Only a way to do it, sir! Say the
word—may I take it?"</p><p>看！給我這個！這正是我想要的。我會把它放在一束花裡，假裝要送給他們。只有一種方法可以做到，先生！說個話—我可以拿走嗎？</p>
<p>"But the man who assumes such a mission," said David Rossi, "must know
himself free from every thought of personal vengeance."</p><p>"但是，"大衛·羅西說，"承擔這樣使命的人，必須知道他自己絕無任何個人報復的想法。"</p>
<p>The dagger trembled in the stranger's hand.</p><p>匕首在陌生人的手中顫抖。</p>
<p>"He must be prepared to realise the futility of what he has done—to
know that even when he succeeds he only changes the persons, not the
things; the actors, not the parts."</p><p>他必須做好準備，去認識到他所做的一切是多麼的無用。即使他成功了，他也只是換了人，並沒有改變事情；換了演員，並沒有改變角色。</p>
<p>The man stood like one who had been stunned, with his mouth partly open,
and balancing the dagger on one hand.</p><p>那名男子站立著，就像被驚呆了一般，嘴巴半開著，一手平衡著匕首。</p>
<p>"More than that," said David Rossi; "he must be prepared to be told by
every true friend of freedom that the man who uses force is not worthy
of liberty—that the conflict of intellects alone is human, and to fight
otherwise is to be on the level of the brute."</p><p>"不僅如此，"大衛·羅西說，“他必須準備好被每一位真正的自由之友告知，使用武力的人不配擁有自由—只有智力的衝突才是人類的，否則的戰鬥只是在動物的層次上。”</p>
<p>The man threw the dagger back on the desk and laughed.</p><p>那個男人把匕首扔回桌子上，然後大笑起來。</p>
<p>"I knew you talked like that to the people—statesmen do
sometimes—that's all right—it's pretty, and it keeps the people
quiet—but <i>we</i>...."</p><p>我知道你是這樣跟人民講話的——政治家有時確實是這樣——這沒關係——這樣很好聽，也能讓人民安靜下來——但是我們....</p>
<p>David Rossi rose with a sovereign dignity, but he only said:</p><p>大衛·羅西以至高無上的威嚴站起來，但他只說了：</p>
<p>"Mr. Minghelli, our interview is at an end."</p><p>明赫利先生，我們的訪談結束了。</p>
<p>"So you dismiss me?"</p><p>所以你打發我走？</p>
<p>"I do," said David Rossi. "It is such men as you who put back the
progress of the world and make it possible for the upholders of
authority to describe our efforts as devilish<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00070" title="50"><a id="Page_50" title="50"></a></span> machinations for the
destruction of all order, human and divine. Besides that, you speak as
one who has not only a perverted political sentiment, but a personal
quarrel against an enemy."</p><p>"我認同，"羅西大衛說，"正是像你這樣的人阻礙了世界的進步，並讓權威的維護者有機會將我們的努力描述為對所有秩序，人類和神聖的破壞性陰謀。除此之外，你的言論就像一個不僅政治觀念被扭曲，還對敵人有個人仇恨的人。"</p>
<p>The man faced round sharply, came back with a quick step, and said:</p><p>那男人猛然轉過身來，迅速回來，並說道：</p>
<p>"You say I speak as one who has a personal quarrel with the Prime
Minister. Perhaps I have! I heard your speech this morning about his
mistress, with her livery of scarlet and gold. You meant the woman who
is known as Donna Roma Volonna. What if I tell you she is not a Volonna
at all, but a girl the Minister picked up in the streets of London, and
has palmed off on Rome as the daughter of a noble house, because he is a
liar and a cheat?"</p><p>您說我說話像是跟首相有個人糾紛一樣。也許我真的有！我今天早上聽到你的演講，談到他的情婦，身著猩紅和金色的制服。你指的是被稱為唐娜·羅馬·福洛納的那個女人。如果我告訴你，她根本不是福洛納，只是首相在倫敦街頭撿起的一個女孩，他因為是個騙子和騙徒，所以將她冒充為貴族之女，推薦給羅馬，你又會怎麼想呢？</p>
<p>David Rossi gave a start, as if an invisible hand had smitten him.</p><p>大衛·羅西突然驚跳，彷彿有隱形之手擊打了他。</p>
<p>"Her name is Roma, certainly," said the man; "that was the first thing
that helped me to seize the mysterious thread."</p><p>"她的名字肯定是羅馬，"男人說，"那是幫助我抓住神秘線索的第一件事。"</p>
<p>David Rossi's face grew pale, and he scarcely breathed.</p><p>大衛·羅西的臉色變得蒼白，他幾乎無法呼吸。</p>
<p>"Oh, I'm not talking without proof," said the man. "I was at the Embassy
in London ten years ago when the Ambassador was consulted by the police
authorities about an Italian girl who had been found at night in
Leicester Square. Mother dead, father gone back to Italy—she had been
living with some people her father gave her to as a child, but had
turned out badly and run away."</p><p>"哦，我可不是沒有證據就說話的，"那個男人說道。"十年前我在倫敦的大使館裡，當時大使被警方請來諮詢一個關於一個在萊斯特廣場夜間被找到的義大利女孩的事情。她的母親已經去世，父親回到了義大利 - 她曾經和一些她的父親在她小時候把她交給的人一起生活，但結果脫離了軌道並逃走了。"</p>
<p>David Rossi had fixed his eyes on the stranger with a kind of glassy
stare.</p><p>大衛·羅西用一種呆滯的凝視看著那個陌生人。</p>
<p>"I went with the Ambassador to Bow Street, and saw the girl in the
magistrate's office. She pleaded that she had been ill-treated, but we
didn't believe her story, and gave her back to her guardians. A month
later we heard that she had run away once more and disappeared
entirely."</p><p>我和大使一起到了弓街，並在法官的辦公室看到了那個女孩。她辯稱自己受到了虐待，但我們並不相信她的故事，並將她交還給了她的監護人。一個月後，我們聽說她再次逃走並完全消失了。</p>
<p>David Rossi was breathing audibly, and shrinking like an old man into
his shoulders.</p><p>大衛·羅西明顯地喘氣，並且像老人一樣縮在他的肩膀裡。</p>
<p>"I never saw that girl again until a week ago, and where do you think I
saw her?"</p><p>我在一個禮拜前從未再見過那個女孩，你猜我在哪裡見到她？</p>
<p>David Rossi swallowed his saliva, and said:</p><p>大衛·羅西嚥下了他的唾液，並說：</p>
<p>"Where?"</p><p>在哪裡？</p>
<p>"In Rome. I had trouble at the Embassy, and came back to appeal to the
Prime Minister. Everybody said I must reach him through Donna Roma, and
one of my relatives<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00071" title="51"><a id="Page_51" title="51"></a></span> took me to her rooms. The moment I set eyes on her
I knew who she was. Donna Roma Volonna is the girl Roma Roselli, who was
lost in the streets of London."</p><p>在羅馬，我在大使館遇到了麻煩，回來向總理提出上訴。每個人都說我必須透過多娜·羅瑪來找他，我的一位親戚帶我去了她的房間。我一看到她就知道她是誰。多娜·羅瑪·沃洛納就是在倫敦街頭迷路的羅瑪·羅塞利女孩。</p>
<p>David Rossi seemed suddenly to grow taller.</p><p>大衛·羅西似乎突然變高了。</p>
<p>"You scoundrel!" he said, in a voice that was hollow and choked.</p><p>"你這無賴！"他的聲音空洞而哽咽地說。</p>
<p>The man staggered back and stammered:</p><p>那個男人搖搖晃晃地後退，並結結巴巴地說道：</p>
<p>"Why ... what...."</p><p>為什麼...什麼...</p>
<p>"I knew that girl. Until she was seven years of age she was my constant
companion—she was the same as my sister—and her father was the same as
my father—and if you tell me she is the mistress.... You infamous
wretch! You calumniator! You villain! I could confound you with one
word, but I won't. Out of my house this moment! And if ever you cross my
path again I'll denounce you to the police as a cut-throat and an
assassin."</p><p>我認識那個女孩。直到她七歲為止，她一直是我的朋友，就像我的姐姐一樣，而她的父親也就像我的父親一樣。如果你告訴我她是情婦……你這個卑鄙的惡棍！你這個誹謗者！你這個惡徒！我可以用一句話來揭穿你，但我不會那麼做。現在就從我家出去！如果你再次出現在我的視線中，我將向警方報告你是個殺人魔和刺客。</p>
<p>Stunned and stupefied, the man opened the door and fled.</p><p>驚愕且呆若木雞的男人開了門就逃走了。</p>
<h3 id="pgepubid00072">V</h3>
<p>David Rossi came out with his long slow step, looking pale but calm, and
tearing a letter into small pieces, which he threw into the fire.</p><p>大衛·羅西以他緩慢的步伐走出來，看上去臉色蒼白但鎮定，並將一封信撕成小塊，扔進了火中。</p>
<p>"What was amiss, sir? They could hear you across the street," said
Bruno.</p><p>"有什麼不對勁，先生？他們可以在街對面聽到你的聲音，"布魯諾說。</p>
<p>"A man whose room was better than his company, that's all."</p><p>一個他的房間比他的陪伴更好的男人，僅此而已。</p>
<p>"What's his name?" said Bruno.</p><p>“他叫什麼名字？”布魯諾說。</p>
<p>"Charles Minghelli."</p><p>查理斯·明赫利</p>
<p>"Why, that must be the secretary who was suspected of forgery at the
Embassy in London, and got dismissed."</p><p>為什麼，那一定是在倫敦大使館被懷疑偽造檔案並被解僱的秘書。</p>
<p>"I thought as much!" said David Rossi. "No doubt the man attributed his
dismissal to the Prime Minister, and wanted to use me for his private
revenge."</p><p>“我就想到了！”大衛·羅西說，“毫無疑問，那個人將他的解僱歸咎於首相，並想利用我來進行他的私人報復。”</p>
<p>"That was his game, was it? Why didn't you let me know, sir? He would
have gone downstairs like a falling star. Now that I remember, he's the
nephew of old Polomba, the Mayor, and I've seen him at Donna Roma's."</p><p>那是他的把戲，是嗎？先生，為什麼您不讓我知道呢？如果我知道的話，他早就像顆墜落的星星般離開了。現在我記起來了，他就是老波隆巴市長的侄子，我在唐娜羅馬家見過他。</p>
<p>A waiter in a white smock, with a large tin box on his head, entered the
hall, and behind him came the old woman from the porter's lodge, with
the wrinkled face and the red cotton handkerchief.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00073" title="52"><a id="Page_52" title="52"></a></span></p><p>一位穿著白色圍裙的服務員，頭上扛著一個大錫盒，走進了大廳。在他後面是來自門房的老婦人，她的臉滿是皺紋，頭上纏著紅色棉質手巾。</p>
<p>"Come in," cried Bruno. "I ordered the best dinner in the Trattoria,
sir, and thought we might perhaps dine together for once."</p><p>"進來吧，"布魯諾叫道。"先生，我在餐館訂了最好的晚餐，我想我們也許可以一次一起用餐。"</p>
<p>"Good," said David Rossi.</p><p>"好的，"羅西大衛說。</p>
<p>"Here it is, a whole basketful of the grace of God, sir! Out with it,
Riccardo," and while the women laid the table, Bruno took the dishes
smoking hot from their temporary oven with its charcoal fire.</p><p>"給你，先生，這是滿籃的上帝之恩！快說，裡卡多，" 當女人們擺設餐桌時，布魯諾從他的暫時性炭火烤箱中取出熱騰騰的菜餚。</p>
<p>"Artichokes—good. Chicken—good again. I must be a fox—I was dreaming
of chicken all last night! <i>Gnocchi!</i> (potatoes and flour baked).
<i>Agradolce</i>! (sour and sweet). <i>Fagioletti</i>! (French beans boiled)
and—a half-flask of Chianti! Who said the son of my mother couldn't
order a dinner? All right, Riccardo; come back at Ave Maria."</p><p>藝術露-挺好的。雞肉-又好了。我一定是一隻狐狸—我昨晚一直在夢見雞肉！義大利土豆團！（烘烤的土豆和麵粉）。
甘酸味！（酸甜）。
法式蒸煮的豆子！以及——半瓶基安蒂酒！誰說我母親的兒子不能點一頓晚餐？好的，裡卡多；在聖母瑪麗亞祈禱後回來。</p>
<p>The waiter went off, and the company sat down to their meal, Bruno and
his wife at either end of the table, and David Rossi on the sofa, with
the boy on his right, and the cat curled up into his side on the left,
while the old woman stood in front, serving the food and removing the
plates.</p><p>服務員離開了，眾人坐下來吃飯。布魯諾和他的妻子坐在桌子的兩頭，大衛·羅西安坐在沙發上，男孩在他的右邊，貓咪蜷縮在他的左邊，而老女人站在前面，擺放食物和拿走盤子。</p>
<p>"Look at him!" said the old woman, who was deaf, pointing to David
Rossi, with his two neighbours. "Now, why doesn't the Blessed Virgin
give him a child of his own?"</p><p>"看看他！"那位聾啞的老婦人說，並指著大衛·羅西和他的兩位鄰居。" 現在，為什麼聖母瑪利亞不給他一個自己的孩子呢？"</p>
<p>"She has, mother, and here he is," said David Rossi.</p><p>"她有了，媽媽，這就是他，"大衛·羅西說。</p>
<p>"You'll let her give him a woman first, won't you?" said Bruno.</p><p>"你會讓她先給他一個女人，對吧？"布魯諾說。</p>
<p>"Ah! that will never be," said David Rossi.</p><p>"啊！那永遠不會發生，" 大衛·羅西說。</p>
<p>"What does he say?" said the old woman with her hand at her ear like a
shell.</p><p>“他說了什麼？”老婦人用手捧著耳朵，好似一隻貝殼。</p>
<p>"He says he won't have any of you," bawled Bruno.</p><p>"他說他不要你們任何一個，"布魯諾大吼道。</p>
<p>"What an idea! But I've heard men say that before, and they've been
married sooner than you could say 'Hail Mary.'"</p><p>多麼棒的主意！但我曾聽過男人們說過這句話，他們比你說'Hail Mary’的速度還要快就結婚了。</p>
<p>"It isn't an incident altogether unknown in the history of this planet,
is it, mother?" said Bruno.</p><p>"這種事件在這個星球的歷史上並非完全未曾發生過，對吧，媽媽？"布魯諾說。</p>
<p>"A heart to share your sorrows and joys is something, and the man is not
wise who wastes the chance of it," said the old woman. "Does he think
parliaments will make up for it when he grows old and wants something to
comfort him?"</p><p>“一個肯與你分享憂愁和喜樂的心是珍貴的，而浪費這種機會的人是不明智的。”老婦人說。“他以為當他年老需要安慰時，議會會彌補這個嗎？”</p>
<p>"Hush, mother!" said Elena, but Bruno made mouths at her to let the old
woman go on.</p><p>"噓，母親！"艾琳娜說，但布魯諾卻衝她做鬼臉，讓老婦人繼續說下去。</p>
<p>"As for me, I'll want somebody of my own about me<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00074" title="53"><a id="Page_53" title="53"></a></span> to close my eyes when
the time comes to put the sacred oil on them," said the old woman.</p><p>至於我，到了灑神聖油閉上眼睛的時候，我會想要有屬於我自己的人在我身旁，"老婦人說。</p>
<p>"If a man has dedicated his life to work for humanity," said David
Rossi, "he must give up many things—father, mother, wife, child."</p><p>"如果一個人決定將他的一生奉獻給為人類服務，"大衛·羅西說，“他必須放棄許多東西 - 父親，母親，妻子，孩子。”</p>
<p>The corner of Elena's apron crept up to the corner of her eye, but the
old woman, who thought the subject had changed, laughed and said:</p><p>愛琳娜的圍裙角悄悄移動到了她眼角，但是那個老婦人以為話題已經轉變，便笑著說：</p>
<p>"That's just what I say to Tommaso. 'Tommaso,' I say, 'if a man is going
to be a policeman he must have no father, or mother, or wife, or
child—no, nor bowels neither,' I say. And Tommaso says, 'Francesca,' he
says, 'the whole tribe of gentry they call statesmen are just policemen
in plain clothes, and I do believe they've only liberated Mr. Rossi as a
trap to catch him again when he has done something.'"</p><p>"那就是我對多馬索所說的。我說，'多馬索，如果一個人要做一個警察，他不能有父母，妻子或者孩子——我覺得他甚至不能有人性。' 多馬索回答我,'弗朗西斯卡，他說，這整個被稱作政治家的群體其實就是便衣警察，我相信他們所謂的釋放羅西先生只是一個陷阱，等他做了什麼事情之後再次逮捕他。'"</p>
<p>"They won't catch <i>you</i> though, will they, mother?" shouted Bruno.</p><p>"他們不會抓到你的，對吧，母親？"布魯諾大叫。</p>
<p>"That they won't! I'm deaf, praise the saints, and can't hear them."</p><p>他們才不會！我是聾的，感謝眾聖，我聽不到他們的聲音。</p>
<p>A knock came to the door, and seizing his mace the boy ran and opened
it. An old man stood on the threshold. He was one of David Rossi's
pensioners. Ninety years of age, his children all dead, he lived with
his grandchildren, and was one of the poor human rats who stay indoors
all day and come out with a lantern at night to scour the gutters of the
city for the refuse of cigar-ends.</p><p>敲門聲響起，男孩抓起他的釘頭錘，跑去開啟門。門檻上站著一位老人。他是大衛·羅西的養老金領取者之一。九十歲高齡，他的子女全都去世，他和孫子孫女住在一起，他是那些整天窩在家裡，晚上握著燈籠出來，翻遍城市的溝渠尋找煙蒂殘渣的貧窮老鼠之一。</p>
<p>"Come another night, John," said Bruno.</p><p>“再來一晚，約翰，” 布魯諾說。</p>
<p>But David Rossi would not send him away empty, and he was going off with
the sparkling eyes of a boy, when he said:</p><p>但是大衛·羅西並不打算讓他空手而歸，而是帶著一雙熠熠生輝的眼睛離開，他說：</p>
<p>"I heard you in the piazza this morning, Excellency! Grand! Only sorry
for one thing."</p><p>今天早上我在廣場聽到你的話，閣下!太棒了!只是有一件事遺憾。</p>
<p>"And what was that, sonny?" asked Bruno.</p><p>"那是什麼，孩子？"布魯諾問。</p>
<p>"What his Excellency said about Donna Roma. She gave me a half-franc
only yesterday—stopped the carriage to do it, sir."</p><p>"他的閣下說起唐娜·羅馬。她昨天只給了我半法郎——為此還讓馬車停下來，先生。"</p>
<p>"So that's your only reason...." began Bruno.</p><p>"所以那就是你的唯一理由......" 布魯諾開始說。</p>
<p>"Good reason, too. Good-night, John!" said David Rossi, and Joseph
closed the door.</p><p>"有充分的理由。晚安，約翰！" 大衛·羅西說，然後約磯關上了門。</p>
<p>"Oh, she has her virtues, like every other kind of spider," said Bruno.</p><p>"哦，她有她的美德，就像其他所有種類的蜘蛛一樣，"布魯諾說。</p>
<p>"I'm sorry I spoke of her," said David Rossi.</p><p>"我很抱歉提起她，"大衛·羅西說。</p>
<p>"You needn't be, though. She deserved all she got. I<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00075" title="54"><a id="Page_54" title="54"></a></span> haven't been two
years in her studio without knowing what she is."</p><p>你其實不用如此。她所受的一切都是活該。我在她的工作室裡待了兩年，我清楚她是怎樣的人。</p>
<p>"It was the man I was thinking of, and if I had remembered that the
woman must suffer...."</p><p>那就是我一直在想的那個男人，如果我記得那個女人必須受苦的話....</p>
<p>"Tut! She'll have to make her Easter confession a little earlier, that's
all."</p><p>嘖！她只需提早一點進行復活節的告解而已。</p>
<p>"If she hadn't laughed when I was speaking...."</p><p>如果她在我說話的時候沒有笑...</p>
<p>"You're on the wrong track now, sir. That wasn't Donna Roma. It was the
little Princess Bellini. She is always stretching her neck and
screeching like an old gandery goose."</p><p>"先生，您現在走錯路了。那不是唐娜·羅馬。那是小公主貝利尼。她總是伸長脖子，並像老鵝一樣尖叫。"</p>
<p>Dinner was now over, and the boy called for the phonograph. David Rossi
went into the sitting-room to fetch it, and Elena went in at the same
time to light the fire. She was kneeling with her back to him, blowing
on to the wood, when she said in a trembling voice:</p><p>晚餐已經結束，男孩呼喚著要聽留聲機。大衛·羅西進入了客廳去取它，與此同時，艾琳娜也進去點燃火爐。她背對他跪在火爐旁，吹著木頭，當她以顫抖的聲音說：</p>
<p>"I'm a little sorry myself, sir, if I may say so. I can't believe what
they say about the mistress, but even if it's true we don't know <i>her</i>
story, do we?"</p><p>"如果我可以這麼說，先生，我自己也有點抱歉。我無法相信他人對女主人的語言，但即使真的如此，我們也不知道她的故事，對吧？"</p>
<p>Then the phonograph was turned on, and Joseph marched to the tune of
"Swannee River" and the strains of Sousa's band.</p><p>然後開啟留聲機，約瑟夫跟著"Swannee River"的旋律和蘇薩的樂隊的音樂進行。</p>
<p>"Mr. Rossi," said Bruno, between a puff and a blow.</p><p>"布魯諾在吸菸與吹煙之間說道，'羅西先生。'"</p>
<p>"Yes?"</p><p>是的？</p>
<p>"Have you tried the cylinder that came first?"</p><p>你有試過第一個出現的圓筒嗎？</p>
<p>"Not yet."</p><p>還沒。</p>
<p>"How's that, sir?"</p><p>那樣如何，先生？</p>
<p>"The man who brought it said the friend who had spoken into it was
dead." And then with a shiver, "It would be like a voice from the
grave—I doubt if I dare hear it."</p><p>帶來那物的人說，曾對它說話的朋友已經死去。然後他打了個寒顫，"就像來自墳墓的聲音——我懷疑我是否有膽量去聽。"</p>
<p>"Like a ghost speaking to a man, certainly—especially if the friend was
a close one."</p><p>就像鬼魂對人說話，當然了—尤其如果那個朋友是親密的。</p>
<p>"He was the closest friend I ever had, Bruno—he was my father."</p><p>他是我生命中最親密的朋友，布魯諾——他是我父親。</p>
<p>"Father?"</p><p>父親？</p>
<p>"Foster-father, anyway. For four years he clothed and fed and educated
me, and I was the same as his own son."</p><p>撫養父親，無論如何。他給我提供了四年的衣食住行和教育，我就像他的親生兒子一樣。</p>
<p>"Had he no children of his own?"</p><p>他沒有自己的孩子嗎？</p>
<p>"One little daughter, no bigger than Joseph when I saw her last—Roma."</p><p>一個小女兒，自從我上次見到她以來，她的體型都和約瑟夫一樣小—羅馬。</p>
<p>"Roma?"</p><p>羅馬？</p>
<p>"Yes, her father was a Liberal, and her name was Roma."</p><p>是的，她的父親是自由主義者，她的名字是羅馬。</p>
<p>"What became of her?"<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00076" title="55"><a id="Page_55" title="55"></a></span></p><p>她後來怎麼樣了？</p>
<p>"When the doctor came to Italy on the errand which ended in his
imprisonment he gave her into the keeping of some Italian friends in
London. I was too young to take charge of her then. Besides, I left
England shortly afterward and went to America."</p><p>當醫生為了最終導致其入獄的任務來到義大利時，他把她交給了在倫敦的一些義大利朋友保管。那時候，我還太年輕，無法照顧她。再者，我在不久之後就離開了英國，前往了美國。</p>
<p>"Where is she now?" said Elena.</p><p>"她現在在哪裡？"艾琳娜說。</p>
<p>"When I returned to England ... she was dead."</p><p>當我回到英國時...她已經去世了。</p>
<p>"Well, there's nothing new under the sun of Rome—Donna Roma came from
London," said Bruno.</p><p>"嗯，羅馬的太陽下並無新事──唐娜·羅馬來自倫敦。"布魯諾說。</p>
<p>David Rossi felt the muscles of his face quiver.</p><p>大衛·羅西感到他的臉部肌肉在抖動。</p>
<p>"Her father was an exile in England, too, and when he came back on the
errand that ended in Elba, he gave her away to some people who treated
her badly—I've heard old Teapot, the Countess, say so when she's been
nagging her poor niece."</p><p>她的父親也曾是英格蘭的流亡者，當他回國辦理了最終導致他流亡到厄爾巴島的任務時，他把她託付給了一些對她不好的人。我聽老茶壺伯爵夫人在嘮叨她可憐的侄女時說過這些。</p>
<p>David Rossi breathed painfully.</p><p>大衛·羅西痛苦地呼吸。</p>
<p>"Strange if it should be the same," said Bruno.</p><p>"布魯諾說，如果真的一模一樣，那就太奇怪了。"</p>
<p>"But Mr. Rossi's Roma is dead," said Elena.</p><p>"但是羅西先生的羅馬已經死了，"伊蓮娜說。</p>
<p>"Ah, of course, certainly! What a fool I am!" said Bruno.</p><p>"啊，當然，肯定！我真是個傻瓜！"布魯諾說。</p>
<p>David Rossi had a sense of suffocation, and he went out on to the lead
flat.</p><p>大衛·羅西有種悶壓的感覺，他走出去到了平鉛蓋的地方。</p>
<h3 id="pgepubid00077">VI</h3>
<p>The Ave Maria was ringing from many church towers, and the golden day
was going down with the sun behind the dark outline of the dome of St.
Peter's, while the blue night was rising over the snow-capped Apennines
in a premature twilight with one twinkling star.</p><p>《Ave Maria》從許多教堂的塔中鳴響，金色的一天隨著太陽的落下而結束，而聖彼得大教堂的黑暗輪廓則隱約可見。同時，藍色的夜晚在帶有一顆閃爍星星的早熟暮色中升起在被雪覆蓋的阿佩尼尼山脈之上。</p>
<p>David Rossi's ears buzzed as with the sound of a mighty wind rushing
through trees at a distance. Bruno's last words on top of Charles
Minghelli's had struck him like an alarum bell heard through the mists
of sleep, and his head was stunned and his eyes were dizzy. He buttoned
his coat about him, and walked quickly to and fro on the lead flat by
the side of the cage, in which the birds were already bunched up and
silent.</p><p>戴維·羅西的耳朵嗡嗡作響，就像遠處樹林中的強風呼嘯。布魯諾在查爾斯·明格利的上面說的最後一句話，讓他如被霧裡的警鐘聲擊中，頭昏眼花。他繫好自己的外套，並在鳥籠旁的平頂上快速來回走動，鳥籠裡的鳥兒早已聚在一起，靜默無聲。</p>
<p>Before he was aware of the passing of time, the church bells were
tolling the first hour of night. Presently he became aware of flares
burning in the Piazza of St. Peter, and of the shadows of giant heads
cast up on the walls of the vast Basilica. It was the crowd gathering
for the last ceremonial<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00078" title="56"><a id="Page_56" title="56"></a></span> of the Pope's Jubilee, and at the sound of a
double rocket, which went up as with the crackle of musketry, little
Joseph came running on to the roof, followed by his mother and Bruno.</p><p>在他尚未察覺時間流逝前，教堂的鐘聲已經敲響了夜晚的第一個時辰。不久後，他察覺到聖伯多祿廣場上燃燒的照明彈，以及巨大的影子投射在龐大的大教堂的牆上。人群正在為教皇銀禧隆重典禮的最後一個儀式聚集起來，一聲雙重的火箭砲響過，如同槍炮的爆響，小約瑟夫跑到屋頂上，他的媽媽和布魯諾跟在後面。</p>
<p>David Rossi took the boy into his arms and tried to dispel the gloom of
his own spirits in the child's joy at the illuminations.</p><p>大衛·羅西抱起這個男孩，試圖以孩子對燈飾的喜悅驅散自己心中的陰霾。</p>
<p>"Ever see 'luminations before, Uncle David?" said Joseph.</p><p>"你之前見過'照明'嗎，大衛叔叔？"約瑟夫說。</p>
<p>"Once, dear, but that was long ago and far away. I was a boy myself in
those days, and there was a little girl with me then who was no bigger
than you are now. But it's growing cold, there's frost in the air,
besides it's late, and little boys must go to bed."</p><p>曾經，我的孩子，但那已經是很久很久以前的事了，也在很遠的地方。那時候我還只是一個男孩，和我在一起的還有一個和你現在一樣大小的小女孩。但現在天氣變冷了，空氣中充滿了霜冷的氣息，而且時間也不早了，小男孩該上床睡覺了。</p>
<p>"Well, God is God, and the Pope is His Prophet," said Bruno, when Elena
and Joseph had gone indoors. "It was like day! You could see the
lightning conductor over the Pope's apartment! Pshew!" blowing puffs of
smoke from his twisted cigar. "Won't keep the lightning off, though."</p><p>"嗯，神就是神，教宗是他的先知，" 布魯諾說，當艾琳娜和約瑟夫走進室內的時候。"就像白天一樣！你能看到教宗公寓上的避雷針！噓！"他吹出扭曲的雪茄的煙。"但是這不能防雷擊。"</p>
<p>"Bruno!"</p><p>布魯諾!</p>
<p>"Yes, sir?"</p><p>是，先生？</p>
<p>"Donna Roma's father would be Prince Volonna?"</p><p>"唐娜·羅馬的父親會是沃隆納王子嗎?"</p>
<p>"Yes, the last prince of the old papal name. When the Volonna estates
were confiscated, the title really lapsed, but old Vampire got the
lands."</p><p>「是的，那是擁有古老教皇姓名的最後一位王子。當沃洛納莊園被沒收時，這個頭銜實際上已經消失，但是那個老吸血鬼得到了那些土地。」</p>
<p>"Did you ever hear that he bore any other name during the time he was in
exile?"</p><p>你有聽過他在流亡期間有使用過其他名字嗎？</p>
<p>"Sure to, but there was no trial and nothing was known. They all changed
their names, though."</p><p>當然可以，但是沒有審判，也沒有人知道任何事情。他們都改了名字。</p>
<p>"Why ... what...." said David Rossi in an unsteady voice.</p><p>"為什麼...什麼..." 大衛·羅西以不穩定的聲音說道。</p>
<p>"Why?" said Bruno. "Because they were all condemned in Italy, and the
foreign countries were told to turn them out. But what am I talking
about? You know all that better than I do, sir. Didn't your old friend
go under a false name?"</p><p>"為什麼?"布魯諾問。 "因為他們在義大利都被定罪了，外國被告知要驅逐他們。但我在講什麼呢？這些你比我更清楚。你的老朋友不是用假名字出去的嗎?"</p>
<p>"Very likely—I don't know," said David Rossi, in a voice that testified
to jangled nerves.</p><p>"非常可能－我不知道，"大衛·羅西以一種顯示他神經緊張的聲音說。</p>
<p>"Did he ever tell you, sir?"</p><p>他有沒有告訴過您，先生？</p>
<p>"I can't say that he ever.... Certainly the school of revolution has
always had villains enough, and perhaps to prevent treachery...."</p><p>"我不能說他曾經....無疑的，革命學校一直都有足夠的壞人，或許是為了防止背叛...."</p>
<p>"You may say so! The devil has the run of the world,<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00079" title="57"><a id="Page_57" title="57"></a></span> even in England.
But I'm surprised your old friend, being like a father to you, didn't
tell you—at the end anyway...."</p><p>你可以這麼說！魔鬼在世界上到處逍遙，甚至在英國也是如此。
但我很訝異，你的老朋友，就像你的父親，最後卻沒有告訴你......</p>
<p>"Perhaps he intended to—and then perhaps...."</p><p>也許他原本打算這麼做——然後也許....</p>
<p>David Rossi put his hand to his brow as if in pain and perplexity, and
began again to walk backward and forward.</p><p>大衛·羅西似乎痛苦和困惑地把手放在額頭上，並再次開始來回地走動。</p>
<p>A screamer in the piazza below cried "<i>Trib-un-a</i>!" and Bruno said:</p><p>下面的廣場中有個尖叫者喊著"報紙!"，布魯諾說：</p>
<p>"That's early! What's up, I wonder? I'll go down and get a paper."</p><p>那真早！我在想發生了什麼事？我要去拿份報紙。</p>
<p>Darkness had by this time re-invaded the sky, and the stars looked down
from their broad dome, clear, sweet, white, and serene, putting to shame
by their immortal solemnity the poor little mimes, the paltry
puppet-shows of the human jackstraws who had just been worshipping at
their self-made shrine.</p><p>到這個時候，黑暗已經再次侵佔了天空，而星星從他們寬闊的穹頂上俯瞰下來，清晰，甜美，白色，平靜無波，用它們不朽的莊嚴使剛剛在自我創造的神壇上祈禱的人類小丑，微不足道的木偶戲的窮人感到羞愧。</p>
<p>As David Rossi returned to the house, Elena, who was undressing the boy,
saw a haggard look in his eyes, but Bruno, who was reading his evening
journal, saw nothing, and cried out:</p><p>當大衛·羅西回到房子時，正在給男孩脫衣的艾琳娜看到他眼中的憔悴，但正在讀晚間報的布魯諾卻沒有發現，反而大聲喊道：</p>
<p>"Helloa! Listen to this, sir. It's Olga. She's got a pen, I can tell
you. 'Madame de Pompadour. Hitherto we have had the pleasure of having
Madame ——, whose pressure on the State and on Italy's wise counsellors
was only incidental, but now that the fates have given us a Madame
Pompadour....' Then there's a leading article on your speech in the
piazza. Praises you up to the skies. Look! 'Thank God we have men like
the Honourable Rossi, who at the risk of....'"</p><p>你好啊！先生，請聽我說，Olga女士有一支筆，我可以告訴你。這是馬丹姆·德·龐帕杜。迄今為止，我們有幸擁有一位馬丹姆——，她對國家和義大利明智的顧問的壓力只是偶然的，但現在命運已經賜予我們一位龐帕杜夫人。然後有一篇關於你在廣場上的演講的社論。贊美你如同贊美天空。看！'感謝上帝，我們有像羅西榮譽男爵這樣的人，他冒著....'</p>
<p>But with a clouded brow David Rossi turned away from him and passed into
the sitting-room, and Bruno looked around in blank bewilderment.</p><p>但是，大衛·羅西眉頭深鎖地從他身旁轉過頭去走進了客廳，布魯諾茫然地四處張望。</p>
<p>"Shall you want the lamp, sir?" said Elena.</p><p>"您需要這盞燈嗎，先生？"艾琳娜說。</p>
<p>"Not yet, thank you," he answered through the open door.</p><p>「還沒有，謝謝你，」他透過開著的門回答。</p>
<p>The wood fire was glowing on the hearth, and in the acute state of his
nerves he shuddered involuntarily as its reflection in the window
opposite looked back at him like a fiery eye. He opened the case of the
phonograph, which had been returned to its place on the piano, and then
from a drawer in the bureau he took a small cardboard box. The wood in
the fire flickered at that moment and started some ghastly shadows on
the ceiling, but he drew a cylinder from the box<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00080" title="58"><a id="Page_58" title="58"></a></span> and slid it on to the
barrel of the phonograph. Then he stepped to the door, shut and locked
it.</p><p>木火在壁爐上熊熊燃燒，他的神經處於高度緊張狀態，不由自主地因窗子裡反射出的火光而打顫，那火光像一隻炙熱的眼睛回瞪著他。他開啟了放在鋼琴上的留聲機的外殼，然後從櫃子的抽屜裡拿出一個小紙板盒。剛在那一刻，壁爐裡的木頭忽明忽暗，天花板上投下了一些可怕的影子，但他從盒子裡取出一個圓筒，並將它滑到留聲機的滾筒上。然後他走到門邊，關上門並將其鎖上。</p>
<h3 id="pgepubid00081">VII</h3>
<p>"Well!" said Bruno. "If that isn't enough to make a man feel as small as
a sardine!"</p><p>"哎喲！" 布魯諾說。"如果那還不足以讓一個人感覺像沙丁魚那麼渺小的話！"</p>
<p>There was only one thing to do, but to conceal the nature of it Bruno
flourished the newspaper and said:</p><p>只有一件事要做，但為了隱藏其性質，布魯諾揮舞著報紙說：</p>
<p>"Elena, I must go down to the lodge and read these articles to your
father. Poor Donna Roma, she'll have to fly, I'm afraid. Bye-bye,
Garibaldi-Mazzini! Early to bed, early to rise, and time enough to grow
old, you know!... As for Mr. Rossi, he might be a sinner and a criminal
instead of the hero of the hour! It licks me to little bits." And Bruno
carried his dark mystery down to the café to see if it might be
dispelled by a litre of autumnal light from sunny vineyards.</p><p>"艾琳娜，我必須去小屋裡，把這些文章讀給你父親聽。可憐的唐娜羅馬，我恐怕她得飛走。再見了，加里波第-馬祖尼！早睡早起，有足夠的時間變老，你知道的！至於羅西先生，他可能是個罪人和罪犯，而不是這個時刻的英雄！我被他搞得一塌糊塗。”布魯諾帶著他的黑暗秘密走下咖啡廳，看看是否能被陽光燦爛的葡萄園的秋天的光芒驅散。</p>
<p>Meantime, Joseph, being very tired, was shooting out a pettish lip
because he had to go to bed without saying good-night to Uncle David; and
his mother, making terms with this pretence, consented to bring down his
nightdress, thinking Rossi might be out of the sitting-room by that
time, and the boy be pacified. But when she returned to the dining-room
the sitting-room door was still closed, and Joseph was pleading to be
allowed to lie on the sofa until Uncle David carried him to bed.</p><p>與此同時，約瑟夫因為非常累而撅著嘴，因為他必須在不跟大衛叔叔說晚安的情況下去睡覺，而他的母親為了應對他的假裝抗議，同意把他的睡衣拿下來，希望羅西可能已經出了起居室，那時候男孩就會被安撫下來。但當她返回餐廳時，起居室的門仍然關著，約瑟夫懇求著能否躺在沙發上，直到大衛叔叔把他帶到床上去。</p>
<p>"I'm not asleep, mamma," came in a drowsy voice from the sofa, but
almost at the same moment the measured breath slowed down, the
watch-lights blinked themselves out, and the little soul slid away into
the darksome kingdom of unconsciousness.</p><p>"我沒有睡覺，媽媽，"沙發上傳來一道昏昏欲睡的聲音，但幾乎在同一刻，規律的呼吸放慢了，守夜燈閃爍自己熄滅，小小的靈魂滑入了黑暗的無意識王國。</p>
<p>Suddenly, in the silence of the room, Elena was startled by a voice. It
came from the sitting-room. Was it Mr. Rossi's voice? No! The voice was
older and feebler than Mr. Rossi's, and less clear and distinct. Could
it be possible that somebody was with him? If so, the visitor must have
arrived while she was in the bedroom above. But why had she not heard
the knock? How did it occur that Joseph had not told her? And then the
lamp was still on the dining-room table, and save for the firelight the
sitting-room must be dark.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00082" title="59"><a id="Page_59" title="59"></a></span></p><p>突然，房間裡的寂靜被一個聲音驚動。這聲音來自客廳。是羅西先生的聲音嗎？不！這個聲音比羅西先生的聲音更老更弱，也不那麼清晰。難道他有訪客嗎？如果是這樣，訪客一定是在她上臥室的時候來的。但為什麼她沒有聽到敲門聲？為什麼約瑟夫沒有告訴她？然後，燈還在餐廳的桌子上，除了壁爐的光，客廳一定很暗。</p>
<p>A chill began to run through her blood, and she tried to hear what was
said, but the voice was muffled by its passage through the wall, and she
could only catch a word or two. Presently the strange voice, without
stopping, was broken in upon by a voice that was clear and familiar, but
now faltering with the note of pain: "I swear to God I will!"</p><p>一股寒意開始在她的血液中流動，她試著去聽清楚那說話的聲音，但是聲音透過牆壁卻變得模糊不清，她只能隱約聽出一兩個詞。突然那個奇異的聲音，沒有停止，卻被一個清晰熟悉的聲音打斷，而那聲音現在卻充滿了痛苦的音調: "我向上帝發誓我會的!"</p>
<p>That was Mr. Rossi's voice, and Elena's head began to go round. Whom was
he speaking to? Who was speaking to him? He went into the room alone, he
was sitting in the dark, and yet there were two voices.</p><p>那是羅西先生的聲音，艾琳娜的頭開始昏昏沉沉。他正在和誰說話？誰在和他說話？他獨自一人走進了房間，他坐在黑暗中，然而卻有兩個聲音。</p>
<p>A light dawned on Elena, and she could have laughed. What had terrified
her as a sort of supernatural thing was only the phonograph! But after a
moment a fresh tremor struck upon her in the agony of the exclamations
with which David Rossi broke in upon the voice that was being reproduced
by the machine. She could hear his words distinctly, and he was in great
trouble. Hardly knowing what she did, she crept up to the door and
listened. Even then, she could only follow the strange voice in
passages, which were broken and submerged by the whirring of the
phonograph, like the flight of a sea-bird which dips at intervals and
leaves nothing but the wash of the waves.</p><p>光明照亮了埃琳娜，她本可以笑出來。她曾被恐嚇的事情，只不過是一臺留聲機！但是片刻之後，她又被大衛·羅西在語音被留聲機再現時的喊叫之痛恐嚇到。她可以清楚地聽到他的話，他現在非常苦惱。她幾乎不知道自己在做什麼，悄悄地走到門口去聽。即使是那樣，她仍然只能跟隨奇怪的聲音在一段段中，聲音斷斷續續，被留聲機的旋轉聲淹沒，就像一隻海鳥時而飛翔時而潛入海浪，只留下海浪的湧動。</p>
<p>"David," said the voice, "when this shall come to your hands ... in my
great distress of mind ... do not trifle with my request ... but
whatever you decide to do ... be gentle with the child ... remember
that ... Adieu, my son ... the end is near ... if death does not
annihilate ... those who remain on earth ... a helper and advocate in
heaven ... Adieu!" And interrupting these broken words were half-smothered
cries and sobs from David Rossi, repeating again and again: "I will!
I swear to God I will!"</p><p>"大衛，"那個聲音說，"當這件事到達你的手中...在我心緒極度困擾之時...不要輕視我的請求...但無論你決定做什麼...都要對那個孩子溫柔...記住這點...再見，我的兒子...結局近了...如果死亡並未消滅...那些仍然留在地球上的人...天堂中的幫助者和辯護者...再見！"在這些斷斷續續的話語中，大衛·羅西半聾的哭聲和嘆息聲中斷，一遍又一遍地重複說："我會的！我向上帝發誓我會的！"</p>
<p>Elena could bear the pain no longer, and mustering up her courage she
tapped at the door. It was a gentle tap, and no answer was returned. She
knocked louder, and then an angry voice said:</p><p>艾琳娜再也無法忍受這份痛苦，鼓起勇氣，她輕輕敲了敲門。敲擊聲十分輕柔，並未得到任何回應。她又敲得更大聲，然後一個憤怒的聲音說道:</p>
<p>"Who's there?"</p><p>那是誰？</p>
<p>"It's I—Elena," she answered timidly. "Is anything the matter? Aren't
you well, sir?"</p><p>"是我—艾琳娜，"她膽怯地回答。"有什麼問題嗎？你感覺不舒服嗎，先生？"</p>
<p>"Ah, yes," came back in a calmer voice, and after a shuffling sound as
of the closing of drawers, David Rossi opened the door and came out.</p><p>"啊，對了，"聲音回復冷靜，伴隨著好像是抽屜關上的聲音後，大衛·羅西開門走了出來。</p>
<p>As he crossed the threshold he cast a backward glance into the dark
room, as if he feared that some invisible hand<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00083" title="60"><a id="Page_60" title="60"></a></span> would touch him on the
shoulder. His face was pale and beads of perspiration stood on his
forehead, but he smiled, and in a voice that was a little hoarse, yet
fairly under control, he said:</p><p>當他越過門檻時，他向黑暗的房間望了一眼，好像他擔心有某個看不見的手會碰他的肩膀。他的臉色蒼白，額頭上滲出汗珠，但他微笑了，並且用一種有點嘶啞但還算冷靜的聲音說道：</p>
<p>"I'm afraid I've frightened you, Elena."</p><p>我怕我把你嚇到了，艾琳娜。</p>
<p>"You're not well, sir. Sit down, and let me run for some cognac."</p><p>您的身體不舒服，先生。請坐下，讓我去拿一些干邑來。</p>
<p>"No! It's nothing! Only...."</p><p>不！沒什麼！只是……</p>
<p>"Take this glass of water, sir."</p><p>先生，請拿這杯水。</p>
<p>"That's good! I'm better now, and I'm ashamed. Elena, you mustn't think
any more of this, and whatever I may do in the future that seems to you
to be strange, you must promise me never to mention it."</p><p>那很好!我現在好多了，我感到羞愧。艾琳娜，你不能再想這件事了，而且無論我將來可能做些什麼你覺得奇怪的事，你必須向我保證永遠不提起。</p>
<p>"I needn't <i>promise</i> you that, sir," said Elena.</p><p>"我沒必要向您保證那個，先生，"艾琳娜說。</p>
<p>"Bruno is a brave, bright, loyal soul, Elena, but there are times...."</p><p>布魯諾是一個勇敢、聰明、忠誠的靈魂，艾琳娜，但有時候......</p>
<p>"I know—and I'll never mention it to anybody. But you've taken a chill
on the roof at sunset looking at the illuminations—that's all it is!
The nights are frosty now, and I was to blame that I didn't send out
your cloak."</p><p>我知道，而且我也絕對不會對任何人提起。你只是在屋頂觀看夜景時受了涼，現在的夜晚已經開始結霜了，我沒給你送披風真是我的過錯。</p>
<p>Then she tried to be cheerful, and turning to the sleeping boy, said:</p><p>然後，她試著讓自己看起來快樂，轉向正在睡覺的男孩說：</p>
<p>"Look! He was naughty again and wouldn't go to bed until you came out to
carry him."</p><p>看！他又頑皮不肯睡覺，直到你出來抱他才願意。</p>
<p>"The dear little man!" said David Rossi. He stepped up to the couch, but
his pale face was preoccupied, and he looked at Elena again and said:</p><p>"親愛的小男人！"大衛·羅西說。他走到沙發前，但他臉色蒼白，心事重重，他再次看著埃琳娜說：</p>
<p>"Where does Donna Roma live?"</p><p>唐娜·羅馬住在哪裡？</p>
<p>"Trinità de' Monti—eighteen," said Elena.</p><p>“特里尼塔山——十八，”埃琳娜說。</p>
<p>"Is it late?"</p><p>是不是太晚了？</p>
<p>"It must be half-past eight at least, sir."</p><p>至少已經是八點半了，先生。</p>
<p>"We'll take Joseph to bed then."</p><p>我們之後就將約瑟帶去睡覺。</p>
<p>He was putting his arms about the boy to lift him when a
slippery-sloppery step was heard on the stairs, followed by a hurried
knock at the door.</p><p>當他正伸出手臂想要抱起男孩時，樓梯上傳來了滑溜溜的腳步聲，緊接著是門上急促的敲門聲。</p>
<p>It was the old Garibaldian porter, breathless, bareheaded, and in his
slippers.</p><p>那是年老的加里波第派門房，氣喘吁吁的，他光著頭，穿著拖鞋。</p>
<p>"Father!" cried Elena.</p><p>"父親！"艾琳娜喊道。</p>
<p>"It's she. She's coming up."</p><p>就是她。她正在上來。</p>
<p>At the next moment a lady in evening dress was standing in the hall. It
was Donna Roma. She had unclasped her ermine cloak, and her bosom was
heaving with the exertion of the ascent.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00084" title="61"><a id="Page_61" title="61"></a></span></p><p>下一刻，一位穿著晚禮服的女士站在大廳裡。她就是唐娜·羅馬。她解開了她的貂皮披風，由於上升的努力，她的胸口正在劇烈地起伏。</p>
<p>"May I speak to Mr. Rossi?" she began, and then looking beyond Elena and
seeing him, where he stood above the sleeping child, a qualm of
faintness seemed to seize her, and she closed her eyes for a moment.</p><p>她開始說：“我可以和羅西先生談話嗎？”然後看著埃琳娜的後方，看到了他，他站在沉睡的孩子上方，一種暈眩的感覺似乎使她困擾，她閉上眼睛片刻。</p>
<p>David Rossi's face flushed to the roots of his hair, but he stepped
forward, bowed deeply, led the way to the sitting-room, and, with a
certain incoherency in his speech, said:</p><p>大衛·羅西的臉紅到了髮根，但他仍然向前走，深深鞠躬，引領著通往客廳的路，然後語無倫次地說道：</p>
<p>"Come in! Elena will bring the lamp. I shall be back presently."</p><p>進來吧！Elena會帶來燈。我馬上就回來。</p>
<p>Then, lifting little Joseph in his arms, he carried him up to bed,
tucked him in his cot, smoothed his pillow, made the sign of the cross
over his forehead, and came back to the sitting-room with the air of a
man walking in a dream.</p><p>然後，他把小約瑟夫抱起來，帶他上床，把他放在嬰兒床裡，整理好他的枕頭，對他的前額做了個十字架的手勢，然後帶著如夢之人般的神情回到客廳。
</p>
<h3 id="pgepubid00085">VIII</h3>
<p>Being left alone, Roma looked around, and at a glance she took in
everything—the thin carpet, the plain chintz, the prints, the
incongruous furniture. She saw the photograph on the piano, still
standing open, with a cylinder exposed, and in the interval of waiting
she felt almost tempted to touch the spring. She saw herself, too, in
the mirror above the mantel-piece, with her glossy black hair rolled up
like a tower, from which one curly lock escaped on to her forehead, and
with the ermine cloak on her shoulders over the white silk muslin which
clung to her full figure.</p><p>被留下獨處的羅馬四處張望，她一眼就看清了所有的東西 - 那薄薄的地毯，平淡的印花布，掛在牆上的印畫，格格不入的傢俱。她看到了放在鋼琴上的照片，琴門仍然敞開，露出一個圓筒，等待間隙，她甚至有點想去摸那個彈簧。她也看到了架在壁爐上方的鏡子裡的自己，那捲成塔狀的亮黑色頭髮，額頭上隨意垂著一縷捲曲的髮絲，以及那披著白色絲織紗質的白貂皮披風，緊緊裹住她豐滿的身軀。</p>
<p>Then she heard David Rossi's footsteps returning, and though she was now
completely self-possessed she was conscious of a certain shiver of fear,
such as an actress feels in her dressing-room at the tuning-up of the
orchestra. Her back was to the door and she heard the whirl of her skirt
as he entered, and then he was before her, and they were alone.</p><p>然後，她聽到了大衛·羅西的腳步聲再次響起，即使她此時已經完全自我控制，她仍然感覺到一種像演員在化妝室裡聽到樂隊調音時的恐懼感。她背對著門，聽到他進來時裙子風起的聲音，然後他就站在她面前，他們獨處一室。</p>
<p>He was looking at her out of large, pensive eyes, and she saw him pass
his hand over them and then bow and motion her to a seat, and go to the
mantel-piece and lean on it. She was tingling all over, and a certain
glow was going up to her face, but when she spoke she was mistress of
herself, and her voice was soft and natural.</p><p>他用寬大而沉思的眼睛看著她，她看見他用手掠過眼睛，然後鞠躬並示意她坐下，並走向壁爐架上倚著。她全身都在顫抖，臉上也漲紅了一片，但當她開口說話時，她完全掌控了自己，聲音柔和自然。</p>
<p>"I am doing a very unusual thing in coming to see you," she said, "but
you have forced me to it, and I am quite helpless."<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00086" title="62"><a id="Page_62" title="62"></a></span></p><p>"我來看你是相當異常的事情，"她說，" 但你逼我這麼做，我完全無能為力。"</p>
<p>A faint sound came from him, and she was aware that he was leaning
forward to see her face, so she dropped her eyes, partly to let him look
at her, and partly to avoid meeting his gaze.</p><p>他發出微弱的聲音，她察覺到他正在向前傾斜以看清她的臉，因此她低下了眼睛，一方面是為了讓他看她，另一方面則是為了避免與他的目光相見。</p>
<p>"I heard your speech in the piazza this morning. It would be useless to
disguise the fact that some of its references were meant for me."</p><p>我今天早上在廣場聽到你的演講。無需掩飾某些內容是針對我的。</p>
<p>He did not speak, and she played with the glove in her lap, and
continued in the same soft voice:</p><p>他沒有說話，她在腿上玩著手套，並持續用同樣的柔和聲音說道：</p>
<p>"If I were a man, I suppose I should challenge you. Being a woman, I can
only come to you and tell you that you are wrong."</p><p>如果我是個男人，我想我會挑戰你。身為女性，我只能來找你並告訴你你錯了。</p>
<p>"Wrong?"</p><p>錯誤？</p>
<p>"Cruelly, terribly, shamefully wrong."</p><p>殘酷地，可怕地，可恥地錯誤。</p>
<p>"You mean to tell me...."</p><p>你是想告訴我...</p>
<p>He was stammering in a husky voice, and she said quite calmly:</p><p>他以嘶啞的聲音結結巴巴地說，而她非常冷靜地回答：</p>
<p>"I mean to tell you that in substance and in fact what you implied was
false."</p><p>我的意思是告訴你，你所暗示的事實和實質內容是錯誤的。</p>
<p>There was a dry glitter in her eyes which she tried to subdue, for she
knew that he was looking at her still.</p><p>她的眼中閃爍著乾澀的光芒，她努力去掩飾，因為她知道他仍在注視著她。</p>
<p>"If ... if...."—his voice was thick and indistinct—"if you tell me that
I have done you an injury...."</p><p>"如果...如果..." 他的聲音沉悶而模糊，"如果你告訴我我傷害了你..."</p>
<p>"You have—a terrible injury."</p><p>你有一個嚴重的傷勢。</p>
<p>She could hear his breathing, but she dared not look up, lest he should
see something in her face.</p><p>她可以聽到他的呼吸聲，但她不敢抬頭看他，唯恐他看出她臉上的某些情緒。</p>
<p>"Perhaps you think it strange," she said, "that I should ask you to
accept my assurance only. But though you have done me a great wrong I
believe you will accept it."</p><p>"或許你覺得奇怪，"她說，"我只讓你接受我的保證。但儘管你對我造成了巨大的錯誤，我相信你會接受它。"</p>
<p>"If ... if you give me your solemn word of honour that what I said—what
I implied—was false, that rumour and report have slandered you, that it
is all a cruel and baseless calumny...."</p><p>如果你能鄭重其事的向我保證，我所說的，我所暗示的都是假的，那些傳聞和報道都是對你的誹謗，這一切都是無根據的殘酷誹謗……</p>
<p>She raised her head, looked him full in the face.</p><p>她抬起頭，直視他的臉。</p>
<p>"I <i>do</i> give it," she said.</p><p>"我給它，"她說。</p>
<p>"Then I believe you," he answered. "With all my heart and soul, I
believe you."</p><p>"那我相信你，"他回答。 "我全心全意地相信你。"</p>
<p>She dropped her eyes again, and turning with her thumb an opal ring on
her finger, she began to use the blandishments which had never failed
with other men.</p><p>她再次低下了眼睛，用拇指轉動手指上的蛋白石戒指，開始使用那些對其他男人從未失敗過的甜言蜜語。</p>
<p>"I do not say that I am altogether without blame," she said. "I may have
lived a thoughtless life amid scenes of poverty and sorrow. If so,
perhaps it has been partly the<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00087" title="63"><a id="Page_63" title="63"></a></span> fault of the men about me. When is a
woman anything but what the men around have made her?"</p><p>"我並沒有說我完全沒有錯，"她說，"可能我在貧困和悲傷的場景中過著無憂無慮的生活。如果是這樣，那麼可能部分是我身邊的男人的錯。什麼時候女人不是被她周圍的男人塑造出來的呢?"</p>
<p>She dropped her voice almost to a whisper, and added: "You are the first
man who has not praised and flattered me."</p><p>她的聲音幾乎降到了耳語的程度，然後補充說：“你是第一個沒有對我讚美和奉承的男人。”</p>
<p>"I was not thinking of you," he said. "I was thinking of another, and
perhaps of the poor working women who, in a world of luxury, have to
struggle and starve."</p><p>"我並沒有在想你,"他說。"我在想的是另一個人，也許還有那些在奢華世界中必須掙扎和挨餓的貧苦工作婦女。"</p>
<p>She looked up, and a half-smile crossed her face.</p><p>她抬頭看，臉上掠過一絲半笑。</p>
<p>"I honour you for that," she said. "And perhaps if I had earlier met a
man like you my life might have been different. I used to hope for such
things long ago—that a man of high aims and noble purposes would come
to meet me at the gate of life. Perhaps you have felt like that—that
some woman, strong and true, would stand beside you for good or for ill,
in your hour of danger and your hour of joy?"</p><p>"我尊重你的行為，"她說。"也許如果我早一些遇到你這樣的男人，我的生活可能會有所不同。很久以前，我曾希望這樣的事情——一個有高尚目標和崇高理想的男人會在生命的門口迎接我。也許你也有過這樣的感覺——一個堅強且真誠的女人，無論是在你的危險時刻還是快樂時刻，都將在你身邊支援你。"</p>
<p>Her voice was not quite steady—she hardly knew why.</p><p>她的聲音有些不穩定——她幾乎不明白為什麼。</p>
<p>"A dream! We all have our dreams," he said.</p><p>"一個夢想! 我們都有自己的夢想,"他說。</p>
<p>"A dream indeed! Men came—he was not among them. They pampered every
wish, indulged every folly, loaded me with luxuries, but my dream was
dispelled. I respected few of them, and reverenced none. They were my
pastime, my playthings. And they have revenged themselves by saying in
secret ... what you said in public this morning."</p><p>確實是個夢！男人們來了——他並不在其中。他們迎合我的每一個願望，縱容我的每一個愚蠢行為，用奢侈品裹挾我，但是我的夢想卻破滅了。我尊重他們中的幾個，但是我未曾敬廷過任何一個。他們是我的消遣，我的玩物。而他們報復我，暗中說出...你今天早晨公開說的話。</p>
<p>He was looking at her constantly with his wistful eyes, the eyes of a
child, and through all the joy of her success she was conscious of a
spasm of pain at the expression of his sad face and the sound of his
tremulous voice.</p><p>他用他那充滿渴望的眼睛不停地看著她，那是一種孩童的眼神。在她成功的喜悅中，她卻因他悲傷表情和顫抖聲音的痛極而感到一陣劇痛。</p>
<p>"We men are much to blame," he said. "In the battle of man with man we
deal out blows and think we are fighting fair, but we forget that behind
our foe there is often a woman—a wife, a mother, a sister, a
friend—and, God forgive us, we have struck her, too."</p><p>"我們男人有太多的過錯，"他說。"在人與人的戰鬥中，我們隨意揮舞拳頭，認為我們是公平對戰，但我們忘記了，在我們的敵人背後通常有一個女人--一個妻子，母親，姐妹，朋友--天佑，我們也傷害了她。"</p>
<p>The half-smile that had gleamed on Roma's face was wiped out of it by
these words, and an emotion she did not understand began to surge in her
throat.</p><p>在這些話語中，羅馬臉上微微閃爍的半笑容被抹去，她的喉嚨開始湧出她無法理解的情緒。</p>
<p>"You speak of poor women who struggle and starve," she said. "Would it
surprise you to hear that <i>I</i> know what it is to do that? Yes, and to be
friendless and alone—quite, quite alone in a cruel and wicked city."</p><p>"你在談論那些掙扎和飢餓的窮女人," 她說。"真的會讓你吃驚，如果說我知道過那樣的生活嗎？是的，我也曾朋友無一、孤苦伶仃——在一個殘酷和邪惡的城市裡，徹徹底底的孤單。"</p>
<p>She had lost herself for a moment, and the dry glitter in her eyes had
given way to a moistness and a solemn expression.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00088" title="64"><a id="Page_64" title="64"></a></span> But at the next
instant she had regained her self-control, and went on speaking to avoid
a painful silence.</p><p>她在那一刻迷失了自己，她眼中的乾澀光芒被眼眶的潮溼和莊重的表情所取代。但在下一刻，她已經恢復了自控，並繼續講話以避免痛苦的沉默。</p>
<p>"I have never spoken of this to any other man," she said. "I don't know
why I should mention it to you—to you of all men."</p><p>"我從未對其他男人提過這件事,"她說。"我不知道為什麼我要對你提到這個－對你這樣的男人來說。"</p>
<p>She had risen to her feet, and he stepped up to her, and looking
straight into her eyes he said:</p><p>她已經站起來，他走向她，直視她的雙眼，他說：</p>
<p>"Have you ever seen me before?"</p><p>你以前有見過我嗎？</p>
<p>"Never," she answered.</p><p>"永不，"她回答。</p>
<p>"Sit down," he said. "I have something to say to you."</p><p>"坐下,"他說。"我有話要對你說。"</p>
<p>She sat down, and a peculiar expression, almost a crafty one, came into
her face.</p><p>她坐了下來，臉上露出一種奇特的表情，幾乎可以說是狡猾的。</p>
<p>"You have told me a little of your life," he said. "Let me tell you
something of mine."</p><p>"你已經跟我分享了你的一部分人生經歷，"他說。"讓我也告訴你一些我的。"</p>
<p>She smiled again. These big children called men were almost to be
pitied. She had expected a fight, but the man had thrown up the sponge
from the outset, and now he was going to give himself into her hands.
Only for that pathetic look in his eyes and that searching tone in his
voice she could have found it in her heart to laugh.</p><p>她再次微笑。這些被稱為男人的大孩子幾乎值得同情。她原本預想會有一場鬥爭，但這個男人從一開始就放棄了抵抗，現在他打算完全交給她做主。如果不是看到他眼中那可憐的神色和他聲音裡那探究的語氣，她本可以找到嘲笑他的理由。</p>
<p>She let her cape drop back from her shoulders, revealing her round bust
and swanlike arms, and crossing one leg over the other she displayed the
edge of a lace skirt and the point of a red slipper. Then she coughed a
little behind a perfumed lace handkerchief and prepared to listen.</p><p>她讓斗篷從肩膀上滑落,露出了豐滿的胸圍和如天鵝一般的手臂,然後她交叉著腿,露出了一截蕾絲裙邊和一隻紅色拖鞋的尖端。然後，她在一塊噴香的蕾絲手帕後輕咳一聲，準備傾聽。</p>
<p>"You are the daughter of an ancient family," he said, "older than the
house it lived in, and prouder than a line of kings. And whatever
sorrows you may have seen, you knew what it was to have a mother who
nursed you and a father who loved you, and a home that was your own. Can
you realise what it is to have known neither father nor mother, to be
homeless, nameless, and alone?"</p><p>"你是一個古老家族的女兒，"他說，"這個家族比它所居住的房子還要古老，比一系列國王還要驕傲。無論你遇到了什麼痛苦，你都知道有一個撫養你的母親，愛你的父親，以及屬於你自己的家。你能理解沒有父母，沒有家，沒有名字，孤獨無助是什麼感覺嗎?"</p>
<p>She looked up—a deep furrow had crossed his brow, which she had not
seen there before.</p><p>她抬起頭來——他的眉心出現了一道深深的皺紋，這是她以前未曾見過的。</p>
<p>"Happy the child," he said, "though shame stands beside his cradle, who
has one heart beating for him in a cruel world. That was not my case. I
never knew my mother."</p><p>"快樂的孩子，"他說，"即使恥辱伴隨著他的搖籃，在這個殘酷的世界中，有一顆心為他而跳。我並非此種情況。我從未認識過我的母親。"</p>
<p>The mocking fire had died out of Roma's face, and she uncrossed her
knees.</p><p>嘲笑的火焰已經從羅馬的臉上消退，她解開了交叉的膝蓋。</p>
<p>"My mother was the victim of a heartless man and a cruel law. She tied
to her baby's wrist a paper on which she had written its father's name,
placed it in the rota at the Foundling of Santo Spirito, and flung
herself into the Tiber."<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00089" title="65"><a id="Page_65" title="65"></a></span></p><p>"我的母親是一個無情男人和殘酷法律的受害者。她將寫有父親名字的紙條繫在嬰兒的手腕上，將其放在聖斯皮裡託的收養機構中，然後投身於臺伯河中。"</p>
<p>Roma drew the cape over her shoulders.</p><p>羅馬把披肩拉過她的肩膀。</p>
<p>"She lies in an unnamed pauper's grave in the Campo Verano."</p><p>她躺在維拉諾公墓中一個無名的窮人墓穴裡。</p>
<p>"<i>Your</i> mother?"</p><p>你的母親？</p>
<p>"Yes. My earliest memory is of being put out to nurse at a farmstead in
the Campagna. It was the time of revolution; the treasury of the Pope
was not yet replaced by the treasury of the King, the nuns at Santo
Spirito had no money with which to pay their pensions; and I was like a
child forsaken by its own, a fledgling in a foreign nest."</p><p>是的，我最早的記憶是被送到坎帕尼亞的一個農莊去養護。那是革命的時代；教皇的財庫還未被國王的財庫所取代，Santo Spirito的修女們沒有錢支付他們的退休金；我就像一個被自己的人遺棄的孩子，是一隻在外面的巢中的幼雛。</p>
<p>"Oh!"</p><p>哦！</p>
<p>"Those were the days when scoundrels established abroad traded in the
white slavery of poor Italian boys. They scoured the country, gathered
them up, put them in railway trucks like cattle, and despatched them to
foreign countries. My foster-parents parted with me for money, and I was
sent to London."</p><p>那些日子裡，海外的惡棍以販賣貧窮的義大利男孩作為白色奴隸貿易。他們在鄉村搜捕，將他們集中，像牲口一樣放在火車貨車裡，然後運到外國。我的養父母為了錢而割愛，我被送到倫敦。</p>
<p>Roma's bosom was heaving, and tears were gathering in her eyes.</p><p>羅馬的胸膛劇烈起伏，眼淚在她的眼眶中湧現。</p>
<p>"My next memory is of living in a large half-empty house in Soho—fifty
foreign boys crowded together. The big ones were sent out into the
streets with an organ, the little ones with a squirrel or a cage of
white mice. We had a cup of tea and a piece of bread for breakfast, and
were forbidden to return home until we had earned our supper. Then—then
the winter days and nights in the cold northern climate, and the little
southern boys with their organs and squirrels, shivering and starving in
the darkness and the snow."</p><p>我的下一個記憶是住在索霍一座半空的大房子裡--五十個外國男孩擠在一起。大一點的孩子被送出去街上帶著風琴，小點的孩子帶著松鼠或一個白色的老鼠籠。我們早餐會有一杯茶和一片麵包，然後被禁止回家，直到我們賺到晚餐為止。然後是在寒冷的北方氣候中的冬日和夜晚，還有那些帶著風琴和松鼠的小南方男孩，在黑暗和雪中顫抖和挨餓。</p>
<p>Roma's eyes were filling frankly, and she was allowing the tears to
flow.</p><p>羅馬的眼睛坦率地充滿了淚水，她讓眼淚自由地流下來。</p>
<p>"Thank God, I have another memory," he continued. "It is of a good man,
a saint among men, an Italian refugee, giving his life to the poor,
especially to the poor of his own people."</p><p>"感謝上帝，我還有另一段記憶，"他繼續說道。"那是一個好人，一位在人群中的聖人，一位義大利的難民，把他的生命獻給了窮人，尤其是他自己人民中的窮人。"</p>
<p>Roma's labouring breath seemed to be arrested at that moment.</p><p>羅馬的呼吸似乎在那一刻停滯了。</p>
<p>"On several occasions he brought their masters to justice in the English
courts, until, finding they were watched, they gradually became less
cruel. He opened his house to the poor little fellows, and they came for
light and warmth between nine and ten at night, bringing their organs
with them. He taught them to read, and on Sunday evenings he talked to
them of the lives of the great men of their country. He is<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00090" title="66"><a id="Page_66" title="66"></a></span> dead, but
his spirit is alive—alive in the souls he made to live."</p><p>他在英國法庭上多次為他們的主人伸張正義，直到他們發現自己被監視，他們逐漸變得不再那麼殘忍。他將他的房子開放給那些可憐的小傢伙，他們在每晚九點至十點之間帶著他們的樂器來尋找光和溫暖。他教他們讀書，並在週日晚上向他們講述他們國家偉大人物的生活。他已去世，但他的精神依然活著——活在他點燃生命火花的靈魂中。</p>
<p>Roma's eyes were blinded with the tears that sprang to them, and her
throat was choking, but she said:</p><p>羅馬的眼睛被湧出來的淚水模糊了，她的喉嚨感到窒息，但她說：</p>
<p>"What was he?"</p><p>他是什麼？</p>
<p>"A doctor."</p><p>醫生</p>
<p>"What was his name?"</p><p>他的名字是什麼？</p>
<p>David Rossi passed his hand over the furrow in his forehead, and
answered:</p><p>"大衛·羅西用他的手摸過他額頭的皺紋，並回答說："</p>
<p>"They called him Joseph Roselli."</p><p>他們叫他約瑟夫·羅塞利。</p>
<p>Roma half rose from her seat, then sank back, and the lace handkerchief
dropped from her hand.</p><p>羅馬半起身離開她的座位，然後又沉回去，她的手中蕾絲手帕掉落。</p>
<p>"But I heard afterwards—long afterwards—that he was a Roman noble, one
of the fearless few who had taken up poverty and exile and an unknown
name for the sake of liberty and justice."</p><p>「但我後來——很久之後才聽說——他原是羅馬的貴族，是那些為了自由和正義而選擇窮困、流亡和不為人知的姓名的無畏少數之一。」</p>
<p>Roma's head had fallen into her bosom, which was heaving with an emotion
she could not conceal.</p><p>羅馬的頭低垂在她的胸口上，無法掩飾那因情緒波動而起伏的胸懷。</p>
<p>"One day a letter came from Italy, telling him that a thousand men were
waiting for him to lead them in an insurrection that was to dethrone an
unrighteous king. It was the trick of a scoundrel who has since been
paid the price of a hero's blood. I heard of this only lately—only
to-night."</p><p>有一天，一封來自義大利的信告訴他，有一千名男子在等待他去帶領他們發起一場旨在推翻一位不義國王的起義。這是一個無賴的詭計，他後來已經付出了英雄的血的代價。我最近才知道這件事，就在今晚。</p>
<p>There was silence for a moment. David Rossi had put one arm over his
eyes.</p><p>片刻間一片寂靜。大衛·羅西用一隻手遮住了眼睛。</p>
<p>"Well?"</p><p>好嗎？</p>
<p>"He was enticed back from England to Italy; an English minister violated
his correspondence with a friend, and communicated its contents to the
Italian Government; he was betrayed into the hands of the police, and
deported without trial."</p><p>他被誘使從英格蘭返回義大利；一位英國部長違反了他與朋友的通訊，並將其內容透露給義大利政府；他被背叛並交到警察手中，然後在未經審判的情況下被驅逐出境。</p>
<p>"Was he never heard of again?"</p><p>他之後就再也沒有訊息了嗎？</p>
<p>"Once—only once—by the friend I speak about."</p><p>「曾經——只有一次——由我所說的那位朋友。」</p>
<p>Roma felt dizzy, as if she were coming near to some deep places; but she
could not stop—something compelled her to go on.</p><p>羅馬感到頭暈，彷彿她正在接近某些深沉的地方；但她不能停下來——有些東西促使她繼續前進。</p>
<p>"Who was the friend?" she asked.</p><p>"她問誰是那位朋友?"</p>
<p>"One of his poor waifs—a boy who owed everything to him, and loved and
revered him as a father—loves and reveres him still, and tries to
follow in the path he trod."</p><p>他的一個貧窮的孤兒，這個男孩對他的一切都感激不盡，並愛戴他如同父親一般，現在依舊熱愛和尊敬他，並試圖效仿他過去的道路。</p>
<p>"What—what was his name?"</p><p>他—他的名字是什麼？</p>
<p>"David Leone."<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00091" title="67"><a id="Page_67" title="67"></a></span></p><p>大衛利奧內</p>
<p>She looked at him for a moment without being able to speak. Then she
said:</p><p>她看著他，一時之間無法開口說話。然後她說：</p>
<p>"What happened to him?"</p><p>他發生了什麼事？</p>
<p>"The Italian courts condemned him to death, and the English police drove
him from England."</p><p>義大利法院判他死刑，英國警方將他驅逐出英國。</p>
<p>"Then he has never been able to return to his own country?"</p><p>那麼他從未能夠返回他自己的國家嗎？</p>
<p>"He has never been able to visit his mother's grave except by secret and
at night, and as one who was perpetrating a crime."</p><p>他從未能夠公開訪問他母親的墓地，只能秘密地且在夜晚，就像是在犯罪一般。</p>
<p>"What became of him?"</p><p>他變成了什麼？</p>
<p>"He went to America."</p><p>他去了美國。</p>
<p>"Did he ever return?"</p><p>他有沒有回來過？</p>
<p>"Yes! Love of home in him, as in all homeless ones, was a consuming
passion, and he came back to Italy."</p><p>是的！他身上的家鄉之愛，就像所有無家可歸的人一樣，是一種燃燒的激情，他回到了義大利。</p>
<p>"Where—where is he <i>now</i>?"</p><p>他現在在哪裡？</p>
<p>David Rossi stepped up to her, and said:</p><p>大衛·羅西向她走去，並說道：</p>
<p>"In this room."</p><p>在這個房間裡。</p>
<p>She rose:</p><p>她起身：</p>
<p>"Then <i>you</i> are David Leone!"</p><p>那麼你就是大衛·萊昂！</p>
<p>He raised one hand:</p><p>他舉起一隻手：</p>
<p>"<i>David Leone is dead!</i>"</p><p>大衛·利昂已經去世了！</p>
<p>There was silence for a moment. She could hear the thumping of her
heart. Then she said in an almost inaudible whisper:</p><p>片刻的寂靜下來。她能聽到自己的心跳聲。然後她幾乎聽不見地低語道：</p>
<p>"I understand. David Leone is dead, but David Rossi is alive."</p><p>我明白。大衛·萊昂已經去世，但大衛·羅西還活著。</p>
<p>He did not speak, but his head was held up and his face was shining.</p><p>他並未說話，但他的頭抬得高高的，臉上光芒四射。</p>
<p>"Are you not afraid to tell me this?"</p><p>你不怕告訴我這件事嗎？</p>
<p>"No."</p><p>否</p>
<p>Her eyes glistened and her lips quivered.</p><p>她的眼睛閃閃發光，嘴唇顫抖。</p>
<p>"You insulted and humiliated me in public this morning, yet you think I
will keep your secret?"</p><p>你今早在公眾面前侮辱和羞辱我，然而你還認為我會保守你的秘密嗎？</p>
<p>"I <i>know</i> you will."</p><p>我知道你會的。</p>
<p>She felt a sensation of swelling in her throbbing heart, and with a slow
and nervous gesture she held out her hand.</p><p>她感覺到心臟如潮水般舒脹起來，隨後她緩慢且緊張地伸出手來。</p>
<p>"May I ... may I shake hands with you?" she said.</p><p>"我可以...我可以跟你握手嗎?"她說。</p>
<p>There was a moment of hesitation, and then their hands seemed to leap at
each other and clasp with a clasp of fire.</p><p>有那麼一瞬間的猶豫，然後他們的手似乎迅速相互疾奔並緊緊抓住，彷彿炙熱的火焰在手中交織。</p>
<p>At the next instant he had lifted her hand to his lips and was kissing
it again and again.</p><p>下一刻他抬起她的手到他的嘴唇，一遍又一遍地親吻。</p>
<p>A sensation of triumphant joy flashed through her, and<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00092" title="68"><a id="Page_68" title="68"></a></span> instantly died
away. She wished to cry out, to confess, to say something, she knew not
what. But <i>David Leone is dead</i> rang in her ears, and at the same moment
she remembered what the impulse had been which brought her to that
house.</p><p>一股勝利的喜悅感觸閃過她的心頭，然後立刻消逝。她想要呼喊，想要承認，想要說些什麼，但她並不清楚要說什麼。但在她耳邊回響的是“大衛·萊昂已死”，同時，她遇到帶領她來到這所房子的衝動是什麼，這在她心中清晰如畫。</p>
<p>Then her eyes began to swim and her heart to fail, and she wanted to fly
away without uttering another word. <i>She</i> could not speak, <i>he</i> could
not speak; they stood together on a precipice where only by silence
could they hold their heads.</p><p>於是她的眼睛開始模糊，她的心開始衰弱，她希望能在不再說一句話的情況下飛走。她無法說話，他也無法說話；他們站在一個懸崖上，只有靜默才能讓他們保持清醒。</p>
<p>"Let me go home," she said in a breaking voice, and with downcast head
and trembling limbs she stepped to the door.</p><p>"讓我回家，" 她聲音顫抖地說，頭低低的，四肢顫抖，她向門口走去。</p>
<h3 id="pgepubid00093">IX</h3>
<p>Reaching the door, she stopped, as if reluctant to leave, and said in a
voice still soft, but coming more from within:</p><p>到達門口時，她停了下來，彷彿不願離開，然後用一種仍然溫和，但更多來自內心深處的聲音說:</p>
<p>"I wished to meet you face to face, but now that I have met you, you are
not the man I thought you were."</p><p>我原本期待能親眼見到你，但現在我見到你了，你並不是我所想像的那樣的人。</p>
<p>"Nor you," he said, "the woman I pictured you."</p><p>"也不是你，"他說，"我心中所想像的那個女人。"</p>
<p>A light came into her eyes at that, and she looked up and said:</p><p>聽到那個，她眼中閃爍出光芒，然後抬頭說：</p>
<p>"Then you had never seen me before?"</p><p>那麼，你之前從未見過我嗎？</p>
<p>And he answered after a moment:</p><p>他過了片刻才回答:</p>
<p>"I had never seen Donna Roma Volonna until to-day."</p><p>直到今天，我從未見過唐娜·羅馬·沃洛納。</p>
<p>"Forgive me for coming to you," she said.</p><p>"請原諒我來找你，"她說。</p>
<p>"I thank you for doing so," he replied, "and if I have sinned against
you, from this hour onward I am your friend and champion. Let me try to
right the wrong I have done you. What I said was the result of a
mistake—let me ask your forgiveness."</p><p>"我感謝你如此做，"他回答，"如果我曾經冒犯過你，從這個時候起，我是你的朋友和捍衛者。讓我嘗試彌補我對你的錯誤。我說的是一個錯誤的結果-讓我請求你的原諒。"</p>
<p>"You mean publicly?"</p><p>你是指公開地？</p>
<p>"Yes!"</p><p>是的！</p>
<p>"You are very good, very brave," she said; "but no, I will not ask you
to do that."</p><p>"你很棒，非常勇敢，"她說；"但不，我不會要求你做那件事。"</p>
<p>"Ah! I understand. I know it is impossible to overtake a lie. Once
started it goes on and on, like a stone rolling down-hill, and even the
man who started can never stop it. Tell me what better I can do—tell
me, tell me."</p><p>啊！我明白了。我知道一旦謊言開始就無法追趕。它就像一顆滾下山坡的石頭，無休無止，即使是發端的人也無法阻止它。告訴我我能做些什麼更好的事情——告訴我，告訴我。</p>
<p>Her face was still down, but it had now a new expression of joy.</p><p>她的臉孔仍然低垂著，但現在卻洋溢著一種全新的喜悅表情。</p>
<p>"There is one thing you can do, but it is difficult."</p><p>你能做的事只有一件，但這很困難。</p>
<p>"No matter! Tell me what it is."</p><p>沒關係！告訴我是什麼。</p>
