      not in Mr. Rossi's handwriting. It is a forgery. I am ready to prove it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "總統先生，"她的哭喊聲穿過眾人，"這封信不是Rossi先生的筆跡。這是偽造的。我已準備好證明它。"
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment one of the Carabineers came back to tell the judges that
      all was over.
    </p>
    <p>就在那一刻，其中一名卡拉賓槍手回來向法官報告，一切都已經結束了。</p>
    <p>
      "Gone!" said one after another, more often with a motion of the mouth than
      with the voice.
    </p>
    <p>"一個接一個地說：“走了！”這話經常是以口型，而不是聲音形式表達出來。"</p>
    <p>
      The president was deeply agitated. "This court stands adjourned," he said,
      "but I take the Almighty to witness that I intend to ascertain all
      responsibility in this case and to bring it home to the guilty ones,
      whosoever and whatsoever they may be."
    </p>
    <p>
      總統非常不安。他說：“本法庭現在休庭，但我要向全能的上帝保證，我打算查明這個案子的所有責任並歸咎於有罪的人，無論他們可能是誰或是什麼。”

      "<span class="smcap">My dear David</span> Rossi,—You will know all about
      it before this letter reaches you. It is one of those scandals of the law
      that are telegraphed to every part of the civilised world. Poor Bruno! Yet
      no, not poor—great, glorious, heroic Bruno! He ended like an old Roman,
      and killed himself rather than betray his friend. When they played upon
      his jealousy, and tempted him by a forged letter, he cried, 'Long live
      David Rossi!' and died. Oh, it was wonderful. The memory of that moment
      will be with me always like the protecting and strengthening hand of God.
      I never knew until to-day what human nature is capable of. It is divine.
    </p>
    <p>
      "親愛的大衛·羅西，你在這封信到達你之前，就會知道所有的事情。這是法律的醜聞之一，被電報傳遍整個文明世界。可憐的布魯諾！不，不是可憐—偉大，光榮，英勇的布魯諾！他像一個古羅馬人一樣結束了生命，寧願自殺也不背叛他的朋友。當他們利用他的嫉妒心，並用一封偽造的信誘惑他時，他喊出：'大衛·羅西萬歲！'然後就死了。哦，這真是驚人。那一刻的回憶將一直伴隨我，就像上帝的保護和強化的手。直到今天，我才知道人類的本性有多神聖。"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But how mean and little I feel when I think of all I went through in the
      court this morning! I was really undergoing the same tortures as Bruno,
      the same doubt and the same agony. And even when I saw through the whole
      miserable machination of lying and duplicity I was actually in terror for
      Bruno lest he should betray you in the end. Betray you! His voice when he
      uttered that last cry rings in my ears still. It was a voice of
      triumph—triumph over deception, over temptation, over jealousy, and over
      self.
    </p>
    <p>
      "但是，當我想到今天早上在法庭上所經歷的一切時，我覺得自己如此卑微與渺小！我真的和Bruno一樣，在經歷著同樣的痛苦、相同的疑惑和同樣的痛苦。即使我看透了整個悲慘的謊言與偽善的陰謀，我實際上仍對Bruno感到恐慌，擔心他到最後可能會背叛你。背叛你！他那最後一句哭喊的聲音還在我耳邊回響。那是一種戰勝欺騙、誘惑、嫉妒和自我的勝利之聲。"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't think, David Rossi, that Bruno died of a broken heart, and don't
      think he went out of the world believing that you were false. I feel sure
      he came to that court with the full intention of doing what he did. All
      through the trial there was something in his bearing which left the
      impression of a purpose unrevealed. Everybody felt it, and even the judges
      ceased to protest against his outbursts. The poor prisoner in convict
      clothes, with dishevelled hair and bare neck, made every one else look
      paltry and small. Behind<span

      him was something mightier than himself. It was Death. Then remember his
      last cry, and ask yourself what he meant by it. He meant loyalty, love,
      faith, fidelity. He intended to say, 'You've beaten me, but no matter; I
      believe in him, and follow him to the last.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "不要以為，大衛·羅西，布魯諾是由於心碎而死，也不要以為他離世的時候認為你是虛偽的。我確信他來到那個法庭，全心全意的想要做他所做的事。在整個審判過程中，他的態度中有些東西給人留下了一種未揭示的目的的印象。每個人都感覺到了，甚至法官也停止了對他的爆發的抗議。可憐的囚犯，穿著囚衣，頭髮凌亂，脖子赤裸裸的，使每個人都顯得微不足道。他身後的東西比他本人還要偉大。那就是死亡。然後記住他最後的呼喊，問問自己他的意思是什麼。他的意思是忠誠，愛，信仰，忠實。他想要說，'你們打敗了我，但沒關系；我相信他，並追隨他到底。'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "As you see, I am here in your own quarters, but I keep in touch with
      'Sister Angelica,' and still have no answer to my letter. I invent all
      manner of excuses to account for your silence. You are busy, you are on a
      journey, you are waiting for the right moment to reply to me at length. If
      I could only continue to think so, how happy I should be! But I cannot
      deceive myself any longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "如你所見，我在你的空間裡，但我還是與'安潔莉卡修女'保持聯繫，卻仍然無法得到我信函的答覆。我編造各種藉口為你的沉默找理由。你忙，你在旅途中，你在等待適合的時候詳細回答我。如果我能繼續這樣想，我將會多麼快樂！但我再也不能欺騙自己了。"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is perhaps natural that you should find it hard to forgive me, but you
      might at least write and put me out of suspense. I think you would do so
      if you knew how much I suffer. Your great soul cannot intend to torture
      me. To-night the burden of things is almost more than I can bear, and I am
      nearly heartbroken. It is my dark hour, dearest, and if you had to say you
      could never forgive me, I think I could easier reconcile myself to that. I
      have been so happy since I began to love you; I shall always love you even
      if I have to lose you, and I shall never, never be sorry for anything that
      has occurred.
    </p>
    <p>
      "也許你發現原諒我很困難是自然的，但你至少可以寫信讓我擺脫掛念。我想如果你知道我有多痛苦，你會這麼做的。你的偉大靈魂不可能意圖折磨我。今晚，事情的重擔幾乎讓我無法承受，我幾乎心碎。這是我最黑暗的時刻，親愛的，即使你說你永遠無法原諒我，我想我也能更輕易地接受。自從開始愛你以來，我一直很快樂；即使我必須失去你，我仍然會一直愛你，而且我永遠，永遠不會對發生的事情感到遺憾。"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not receiving any new letters from you, I am going back on the old ones,
      and there is a letter of only two months ago in which you speak of just
      such a case as mine. May I quote what you say?
    </p>
    <p>
      "我沒有收到你的新信，所以我在重讀舊信中。其中有一封只有兩個月的信，你在信中提到了一個和我現在情況相似的案例。我可以引用你說的話嗎？"
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Yet even if she were not so (<i>i.e</i>. worthy of your love and
      friendship), even if there were, as you say, a fault in her, who am I that
      I should judge her harshly? ... I reject the monstrous theory that while a
      man may redeem the past a woman never can.... And if she has sinned as I
      have sinned, and suffered as I have suffered, I will pray for strength to
      say, 'Because I love her we are one, and we stand or fall together.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "`即使她不是如此（即，值得你的愛和友誼），即使她真的如你所說，有所過錯，我又有什麼資格嚴厲地去評判她呢？...我完全否定那種怪誕的理著，認為男人可以挽回過去，而女人卻永遠不能...。如果她像我一樣犯了錯，像我一樣受過苦，我會祈禱給我力量說，‘因為我愛她，我們是一體的，我們一起立下或一起墮落。'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is so beautiful that I am even happy while my pen copies the sweet,
      sweet words, and I feel as I did when the old priest spoke so tenderly on
      the day I confessed, telling me I had committed no sin and had nothing to
      repent of. Have I never told you about that? My confessor was a Capuchin,
      and perhaps I should have waited for his advice before going farther. He
      was to consult his General or his Bishop<span

      or some one, and to send for me again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "這是如此美麗，以至於我在抄寫這些甜蜜的，甜蜜的詞句時甚至感到快樂，我感覺就像在我告解的那天，老神父如此溫柔地說話時一樣，他告訴我我並未犯下任何罪孽，也無需懺悔。我有沒有告訴過你關於那個的？我的神父是個門脂會修士，也許在走得更遠之前，我應該等待他的意見。他要去諮詢他的將軍或主教還是某人，然後再來找我。"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But all that is over now, and everything depends upon you. In any case,
      be sure of one thing, whatever happens. Bruno has taught me a great
      lesson, and there is not anything your enemies can do to me that will
      touch me now. They have tried me already with humiliation, with poverty,
      with jealousy, and even with the shadow of shame itself. There is nothing
      left but death.
      <i>And death itself shall find me faithful to the last</i>. Good-bye! Your
      poor unforgiven girl,
    </p>
    <p>
      "但是，所有那些都已經結束了，一切都取決於你。無論如何，請確定一件事，不管發生什麼。布魯諾已經教給我一個重大的教訓，現在你的敵人再也不能對我做什麼能夠觸及我的事情了。他們已經用羞辱、貧窮，甚至羨慕和恥辱的陰影試探過我。只剩下死亡。而死亡也將發現我忠誠到底。再見！你可憐的，未被原諒的女孩，"

      On the morning appointed for the visit to the Vatican, Roma dressed in the

    <p>
      約定參觀梵蒂岡的那個早晨，羅馬穿上了被禮節規定的黑色禮服和面紗，準備去見教宗。
    </p>
    <p>
      The young Noble Guard in civilian clothes was waiting for her in the
      sitting-room. When she came out of the bedroom he was standing with a
      solemn face before the bust of David Rossi, which she had lately cast
      afresh and was beginning to point in marble.
    </p>
    <p>
      一名年輕的貴族衛士穿著便服，在客廳等待著她。當她從臥室出來時，他正嚴肅地站在大衛·羅西的半身像前，她最近重新鑄造了這個半身像，並開始用大理石精雕細琢。
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is wonderful," he said. "Perfectly wonderful! A most astonishing
      study."

    <p>"這真是太棒了，"他說。"簡直太棒了！這是一個最令人驚訝的研究。"</p>

    <p>羅馬向他微笑並鞠躬。</p>
    <p>
      "Christ of course, and such reality, such feeling, such love! But shall I
      tell you what surprises me most of all?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "基督當然，還有那樣的現實，那樣的感情，那樣的愛！但是我應該告訴您最讓我驚訝的事情嗎？"
    </p>
    <p>"What?"</p>
    <p>"什麼？"</p>
    <p>
      "What surprises me most is the extraordinary resemblance between your
      Christ and the Pope."
    </p>
    <p>"令我最驚訝的是，你們的基督和教皇之間的非凡相似性。"</p>
    <p>"Really?"</p>
    <p>"真的嗎？"</p>
    <p>
      "Indeed yes! Didn't you know it? No? It is almost incredible. Younger
      certainly, but the same features, the same expression, the same
      tenderness, the same strength! Even the same vertical lines over the nose
      which make the shako dither on one's head when something goes wrong and
      His Holiness is indignant."
    </p>
    <p>
      "確實如此！你難道不知道嗎？還真不知道嗎？這幾乎是不可思議。雖然更年輕，但具有相同的面部特徵，相同的表情，相同的溫柔，相同的力量！甚至那些在鼻樑上的垂直線條也相同，它們在出現困難，並且教宗憤怒時，會讓軍帽在頭上晃動。"

      Roma's smile was dying off her face like the sun off a field of corn, and
      she was looking sideways out of the window.

      "羅馬的笑容就像陽光從玉米田中消逝一樣,開始從她臉上褪去。她正側著臉看窗外。"
    </p>
    <p>"Has the Pope any relations?" she asked.</p>
    <p>"教宗有任何親戚嗎？"</p>
    <p>
      "None whatever, not a soul. The only son of an only son. You must have
      been thinking of the Holy Father himself, and asking yourself what he was
      like thirty years ago. Come now, confess it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "一點都沒有，一點都沒有。唯一的兒子的唯一的兒子。您一定是想起了教宗本人，並問自己他三十年前是什麼樣的。來吧，承認吧!"

    <p>Roma laughed. The soldier laughed. "Shall we go?" she said.</p>
    <p>羅馬笑了。士兵也笑了。“我們走吧？”她說。</p>

      Tor di Nona, a narrow lane which skirts the banks of the Tiber, across the
      bridge of St. Angelo, and up the Borgo.

      他們有一輛馬車在等候，他們經過托爾迪諾納，這是一條沿著台伯河岸的狹窄小巷，越過聖安祖洛橋，然後向上走到博戈。

      Roma was nervous and preoccupied. Why had she been sent for? What could
      the Pope have to say to her?

    <p>
      "Isn't it unusual," she asked, "for the Pope to send for any
      one—especially a woman, and a non-Catholic?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "難道不奇怪嗎?"她問，"教皇會傳召任何人——尤其是一個女人，而且還不是天主教徒嗎?"
    </p>
    <p>"Most unusual. But perhaps Father Pifferi...."</p>
    <p>"最不尋常。 但也許Pifferi神父...."</p>
    <p>"Father Pifferi?"</p>
    <p>"父親皮費瑞？"</p>
    <p>"He is the Holy Father's confessor."</p>
    <p>"他是教宗的告解師。"</p>
    <p>"Is he a Capuchin?"</p>
    <p>"他是閣布津嗎？"</p>
    <p>"Yes. The General at San Lorenzo."</p>
    <p>"是的。位於聖洛倫索的將軍。"</p>
    <p>
      "Ah, now I understand," said Roma. Light had dawned on her and her spirits
      began to rise.
    </p>
    <p>"啊，現在我明白了，"羅馬說。她開始理解，她的精神開始振作起來。</p>
    <p>"The Pope is very tender and fatherly, isn't he?"</p>
    <p>"教皇非常和藹且像父親般的，不是嗎？"</p>
    <p>
      "Fatherly? He is a saint on earth, that's what he is! Impetuous, perhaps,
      but so sweet and generous and forgiving. Makes you shake in your shoes if
      you've done anything amiss, but when all is over and he puts his arm on
      your shoulder and tells you to think no more about it, you're ready to die
      for him even at the stake."
    </p>
    <p>
      "父親般的？他就是地球上的聖人！也許衝動，但非常甜蜜、慷慨和寬恕。如果你做錯了什麼，他會讓你害怕得發抖。但當一切結束，他將手臂放在你的肩膀上，告訴你不再想它，你會願意甚至在火刑柱上為他犧牲自己。"
    </p>
    <p>
      Roma's spirits were rising every minute, and her nervousness was fading
      away. Since things had fallen out so, she could take advantage of her
      opportunities. She would tell the Pope everything, and he would advise
      with her and counsel her. She would speak about David Rossi, and the Pope
      would tell her what to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      羅馬的精神每分鐘都在提升，她的緊張情緒也在消退。既然事情已經發生了，她可以利用自己的機會。她將把所有事情告訴教皇，他會對她進行指導和勸告。她會提起大衛·羅西，教皇會告訴她該怎麼做。

      The great clock of the Basilica was striking ten with a solemn boom as the

      They alighted at the bronze gate, ascended the grand staircase, crossed a
      courtyard, passed through many gorgeous chambers, and arrived finally at
      an apartment hung with tapestries and occupied by a Noble Guard, who wore
      a brass helmet and held a drawn sword. The next room was the throne room,
      and beyond it were the Pope's private apartments.
    </p>
    <p>
      他們在銅門下車，上了宏偉的樓梯，穿過了一個庭院，經過了許多華麗的房間，最後來到了一個掛著掛毯的公寓，由一個貴族護衛住宿，他戴著一個黃銅頭盔並拿著一把劍。
      下一個房間是皇室，而且它後面是教宗的私人公寓。
    </p>
    <p>
      A chaplain of the Pope's household came to say that by request of Father
      Pifferi the lady was to step into an anteroom; and Roma followed him into
      a small adjoining chamber, carpeted with cocoanut matting and furnished
      with a marble-topped table and two wooden chest-seats, bearing the papal
      arms. The little room opened on to a corridor overlooking<span

      a courtyard, a secret way to the Pope's private rooms, and it had a door
      to the throne room also.
    </p>
    <p>
      教皇的牧師來傳達一個消息，根據Pifferi神父的要求，這位女士應進入一個側廳，於是Roma跟隨他走進了一個小房間。該房間用椰子毯子鋪就，配有一張大理石頂桌子和兩個木製箱形座位，上面有教皇的徽章。這個小房間通向俯瞰庭院的走廊，這是通往教皇私人房間的秘密路徑，它也有一扇通往王座室的門。
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Father will be here presently," said the chaplain, "and His Holiness
      will not be long."
    </p>
    <p>"將會有神父來到這裡，" 牧師說， "他的聖潔也不會久等。"</p>
    <p>
      Roma, who was feeling some natural tremors, tried to reassure herself by
      asking questions about the Pope. The chaplain's face began to gleam. He
      was a little man, with round red cheeks and pale grey eyes, and the usual
      tone of his voice was a hushed and reverent whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      "羅馬, 她感覺到一些天然的震顫,
      試圖透過詢問有關教皇的問題來安撫自己。牧師的臉開始發光。他是一個小個子男人，有著圓圓的紅臉頰和蒼白的灰色眼睛，他的聲音通常是低聲而恭敬的耳語。"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Faint? Yes, ladies do faint sometimes—often, I may say—and they nearly
      always cry. But the Holy Father is so gentle, so sweet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "昏厥？是的，有時候女士們會昏厥-我可以說經常，她們幾乎總是會哭泣。但是聖父是如此的溫柔，如此的甜美。"
    </p>
    <p>
      The door to the throne room opened and there was a gleam of violet and an
      indistinct buzz of voices. The chaplain disappeared, and at the next
      moment a man in the dress of a waiter came from the corridor carrying a
      silver soup dish.
    </p>
    <p>
      皇位室的門開啟了，洋溢出一股紫羅蘭的光芒和模糊的談話聲。牧師消失了，下一刻，一個穿著侍者服裝的男子從走廊走出，手裡拿著一個銀湯碗。
    </p>
    <p>"You're the lady the Holy Father sent for?"</p>
    <p>"您就是教宗召見的那位女士嗎？"</p>
    <p>Roma smiled and assented.</p>
    <p>洛馬微笑並同意。</p>
    <p>
      "I'm Cortis—Gaetano Cortis—the Pope's valet, you know—and of course I hear
      everything."
    </p>
    <p>
      「我是科提斯 - 蓋塔諾科提斯 - 你知道的，教皇的僕人，我當然聽到了一切。」
    </p>
    <p>Roma smiled again and bowed.</p>
    <p>羅馬再次微笑並鞠躬。</p>
    <p>
      "I bring the Holy Father a plate of soup every morning at ten, but I'm
      afraid it is going to get cold this morning."
    </p>
    <p>"我每天早上十點給教宗帶一盤湯，但我擔心今天早上會變冷。"</p>
    <p>"Will he be angry?"</p>
    <p>“他會生氣嗎？”</p>
    <p>"Angry? He's an angel, and couldn't be angry with any one."</p>
    <p>"生氣？他是天使，不可能對任何人生氣。"</p>
    <p>"He must indeed be good; everybody says so."</p>
    <p>"他確實一定很好; 每個人都這麼說。"</p>
    <p>
      "He is perfect. That's about the size of it. None of your locking up his
      bedroom when he goes into the garden and putting the key into the pocket
      of his cassock, same as in the old Pope's days. I go in whenever I like,
      and he lets me take whatever I please. At Christmas some rich Americans
      wanted a skull-cap to save a dying man, and I got it for the asking. Now
      an old English lady wants a stocking to cure her rheumatism, and I'll get
      that too. I've saved a little hair from the last cutting, and if you hear
      of anybody...."
    </p>
    <p>
      "他就是完美的化身。就是這樣。他並不像舊時的教皇那樣，出門到花園的時候鎖起自己的臥室，然後將鑰匙放入長袍的口袋。我隨時都可以進去，他讓我任意取用。在聖誕節時，一些有錢的美國人想要一頂髮冠來拯救一個瀕死的人，我只需一句話就得到了。現在，一位老年的英國女士想要一隻襪子來治療她的風濕病，我也將得到。上一次剪髮時我保存了一些頭髮，如果你聽到有人需要..."
    </p>
    <p>
      The valet's story of his perquisites was interrupted by the opening of the
      door of the throne room and the entrance of a friar in a brown habit. It
      was Father Pifferi.
    </p>
    <p>
      `僕人關於他的特權的故事被寶座房間的門開啟以及一位穿著棕色僧袍的修士的進入所打斷。那是Pifferi神父。`

      behind the valet, he gathered up the skirts of his habit and sat down on
      the chest-seat in front of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "別起來，我的女兒，"他說，並在僕人關上門後，他撩起自己衣服的裙子，坐在她面前的箱子座位上。
    </p>
    <p>
      "When you came to me with your confidence, my child, and I found it
      difficult to advise with you for your peace of mind, I told you I wished
      to take your case to a wiser head than mine. I took it to the Pope
      himself. He was touched by your story, and asked to see you for himself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "當你帶著自信來找我，我的孩子，我發現要給你心靈的平靜提供建議有些困難，我告訴你我希望將你的情況帶給比我更有智慧的人。我把它帶給了教皇本人。他被你的故事所打動，並要求親自見你。"
    </p>
    <p>"But, Father...."</p>
    <p>"但是，父親...."</p>
    <p>
      "Don't be afraid, my daughter. Pius the Tenth as a Pope may be lofty to
      sternness, but as a man he is humble and simple and kind. Forget that he
      is a sovereign and a pontiff, and think of him as a tender and loving
      friend. Tell him everything. Hold nothing back. And if you must needs
      reveal the confidences of others, remember that he is the Vicar of Him who
      keeps all our secrets."
    </p>
    <p>
      "不要害怕，我的女兒。作為教皇的庇護十世可能威嚴至極，但作為一個人，他卻是謙遜、單純和仁慈的。請你忘記他是一個統治者和教皇，想他只是一個溫柔且愛你的朋友。傾訴給他所有的事情，不要有任何保留。即使你必須揭示他人的秘密，也要記住他是那位保護我們所有秘密的神的代理人。"
    </p>
    <p>"But, Father...."</p>
    <p>"但是，爸爸...."</p>
    <p>"Yes."</p>
    <p>"是的。"</p>
    <p>
      "He is so high, so holy, so far above the world and its temptations...."
    </p>
    <p>"他是如此崇高，如此神聖，遠在世界及其誘惑之上...."</p>
    <p>
      "Don't say that, my daughter. The Holy Father is a man like other men.
      Shall I tell you something of his life? The world knows it only by hearsay
      and report. You shall hear the truth, and when you have heard it you will
      go to him as a child goes to its father, and no longer be afraid."
    </p>
    <p>
      "別這樣說，我的女兒。教皇也是一個人。我該告訴你一些他的生活故事嗎？世界只是以聞說和報導的方式知道他的事。你將聽到真相，當你瞭解後，你會像一個孩子去找她的父親，而不再害怕。"

    <p>
      "Thirty-five years ago," said Father Pifferi, "the Holy Father had not
      even dreamt of being Pope. He was the only child of a Roman banker, living
      in a palace on the opposite side of the piazza. The old Baron had visions,
      indeed, of making his son a great churchman by the power of wealth, but
      these were vain and foolish, and the young man did not share them. His own
      aims were simple but worldly. He desired to be a soldier, and to
      compromise with his father's disappointed ambitions he asked for a
      commission in the Pope's Noble Guard."
    </p>
    <p>
      "三十五年前，"皮菲里神父說，"當時的教宗還沒有做教宗的夢。他是一個羅馬銀行家的獨生子，在廣場對面的一座宮殿中生活。老男爵確實有幻想利用財富使他的兒子成為一位大教士，但這些都是徒然和愚蠢的，年輕人並不與之共鳴。他自己的目標很簡單但世俗。他渴望成為一位士兵，為了滿足父親失望的期待，他竟然求就教宗的貴族衛隊的職位。"
    </p>
    <p>
      The old friar put his hands into the vertical pockets in the breast of his
      habit, and looked up at the ceiling as he went on speaking.
    </p>
    <p>那位老僧侶將手插進他僧袍胸前的直立口袋裡，繼續說話時抬頭看著天花板。</p>
    <p>
      "All this is no secret, but what follows is less known. The soldier, who
      had the charm of an engaging personality,<span

      led the life of an ordinary young Roman of his day, frequenting cafés,
      concerts, theatres, and balls. In this character he met a poor woman of
      the people, and came to love her. She was a good girl, with soft and
      gentle manners, but a heart of gold and a soul of fire. He was a good man
      and he meant to marry her. He did marry her. He married her according to
      the rites of the Church, which are all that religion requires and God
      calls for."
    </p>
    <p>
      "這些都不是秘密，但隨後的情況就較少人知道。那名士兵具有吸引人的個性魅力，他過著一個普通的年輕羅馬人的生活，常常去咖啡館，音樂會，劇院和舞會。在這樣的角色中，他遇到了一個窮苦的平民女子，並愛上了她。她是個好女孩，態度溫柔且友善，但她有一顆黃金般的心和炙熱如火的靈魂。他是好人，他打算娶她。他確實娶了她。他按照教堂的儀式娶了她，這是宗教所要求的所有事物，也是上帝的呼召。"
    </p>
    <p>
      Roma was leaning forward on her seat and breathing between tightly-closed
      lips.
    </p>
    <p>"羅馬正前傾在她的座位上，並且緊緊閉著嘴唇進行呼吸。"</p>
    <p>
      "Unhappily, then as now, a godless legislature had separated a religious
      from a civil marriage, and the one without the other was useless. The old
      Baron heard of what had happened and tried to defeat it. A cardinal had
      just been created in Australia, and an officer of the Noble Guard had to
      be sent with the Ablegate to carry the biglietto and the skull-cap. At the
      request of the Baron his son was appointed to that mission and despatched
      in haste."
    </p>
    <p>
      "不幸的是，就像現在一樣，一個無神論的立法機關將宗教婚姻與民事婚姻分開，缺一不可。老男爵聽說了這件事，試圖阻止。澳洲剛創立了一位樞機主教，一位貴族衛隊的軍官必須與該樞機主教一同送去告知書和樞機主教的帽子。應男爵的要求，他的兒子被任命為該任務的負責人，並被迅速派遣出去。"
    </p>
    <p>Roma could scarcely control herself.</p>
    <p>"羅馬幾乎無法控制自己。"</p>
    <p>
      "The young husband being gone, the father set himself to deal with the
      wife. He had not yet relinquished his hopes of seeing his son a churchman,
      and marriage was a fatal impediment. A rich man may have many instruments,
      and the Baron was able to use some that were evil. He played upon the
      conscience of the girl, who was pure and virtuous; told her she was not
      legally married, and that the laws of her country thought ill of her.
      Finally, he appealed to her love for her husband, and showed her that she
      was standing in his way. He was not a bad man, but he loved his son beyond
      truth and to the perversion of honour, and was ready to sacrifice the
      woman who stood between them. She allowed herself to be sacrificed. She
      wiped herself out that she might not be an obstacle to her husband. She
      drowned herself in the Tiber."
    </p>
    <p>
      "年輕的丈夫離開之後，父親便開始與妻子打交道。他仍未放棄希望看到自己的兒子成為教士，而婚姻卻是一個致命的障礙。富有的人可能有許多工具，男爵能夠利用其中一些惡劣的手段。他影響了那位純潔、有道德的女孩的良知，告訴她她並未合法結婚，她的國家的法律對她有不良的評價。最後，他呼籲她對丈夫的愛，告訴她她正在阻礙丈夫的道路。他並不是一個壞人，但他熱愛他的兒子超越了真理，甚至以女人的名譽為代價，願意犧牲那位站在他們之間的女人。她准許自己被犧牲。她為了不成為她丈夫的阻礙，選擇自我消滅。她在台伯河中投身自盡。"
    </p>
    <p>
      Roma could not control herself any longer, and made a half-stifled
      exclamation.
    </p>
    <p>"羅馬再也無法控制自己，發出了半壓抑的驚叫。"</p>
    <p>
      "Then the young husband returned. He had been travelling constantly, and
      no letters from his wife had reached him. But one letter was waiting for
      him at Rome, and it told him what she had done. It was then all over;
      there was no help for it, and he was overwhelmed with horror. He could not
      blame the poor dead girl, for all she had done had been done in love; he
      could not blame himself, for he had<span

      meant no wrong in making the religious marriage, and had hastened home to
      complete the civil one; and he could not reproach his father, for if the
      Baron's conduct had led to fearful consequences, it had been prompted by
      affection for himself. But the hand of God seemed to be over him, and his
      soul was shaken to its foundations. From that time forward he renounced
      society and all worldly pleasures. For eight days he went into retreat and
      prayed fervently. On the ninth day he joined a religious house, the
      Novitiate of the Capuchins at San Lorenzo. The young soldier, so gay, so
      handsome, so fond of social admiration, became a friar."
    </p>
    <p>
      然後，年輕的丈夫回來了。他一直在旅行，沒有收到來自他妻子的任何信件。但羅馬有一封信等著他，告訴他她所做的事。那時一切都結束了，無法再挽救，他被恐懼所淹沒。他不怪那個窮困的死去的女孩，因為她所做的一切都是出於愛；他不能責怪自己，因為他在進行宗教婚禮時並沒有想做錯事，而且他也洗帶著回家完成民事婚禮；他也不能責怪他的父親，因為如果男爵的行為導致了可怕的後果，那也是出於對他自己的愛。但上帝的手似乎在他身上，他的靈魂深受震撼。從那時起，他放棄了社會和所有世俗的樂趣。八天內，他退隱並熱情祈禱。第九天，他加入了一個宗教房屋，位於聖洛倫索的卡普奇諾修會新進修士。那位曾經如此快樂、英俊、如此喜歡社交讚美的年輕士兵變成了一名修道士。
    </p>
    <p>
      The old Capuchin looked tenderly at Roma, whose wet eyes and burning
      cheeks seemed to tell of sympathy with his story.
    </p>
    <p>
      那位老卡普奇諾僧依依不捨地看著羅馬，他那濕濕的眼睛和紅潤的臉頰似乎在流露對他故事的同情。

      "In those days, my daughter, the nuns of Thecla served the Foundling of
      Santo Spirito."

    <p>在那些日子裡，我的女兒，忒克拉的修女們照顧著聖托斯皮里託的棄嬰。</p>
    <p>Roma began to look frightened and to feel faint.</p>
    <p>"羅馬開始看起來很害怕，感到有些暈眩。"</p>
    <p>
      "It was usual for a member of our house to live in the hospital in order
      to baptize the children and to confess the sick and the dying. We took it
      in turns to do so, staying one year, two years, three years, and then
      going back to the monastery. I was myself at Santo Spirito for this
      purpose at the time I speak about, and it was not until three or four
      years afterwards that I became Superior of our House and returned to San
      Lorenzo. There I found the young Noble Guard, and, wisely or unwisely, I
      told him a new phase of his own story."
    </p>
    <p>
      "我們家中的成員通常會住在醫院中，以對學生進行洗禮並給病人和臨終者作告解。我們輪流這樣做，留在那裡一年，兩年，三年，然後回到修道院。我在說這些事情的時候，我為了這個目的在Santo
      Spirito，直到三或四年後，我才成為我們家的主管並返回到San
      Lorenzo。在那裡，我找到了年輕的Noble
      Guard，不管是否明智，我都告訴他他自己故事的新階段。"
    </p>
    <p>"There was a child?" said Roma, in a strange voice.</p>
    <p>"有一個孩子嗎？" 羅馬用奇怪的聲音說。</p>
    <p>
      The Capuchin bent his head. "That much he knew already by the letter his
      wife had left for him. She had intended that the child should die when she
      died, and he supposed that it had been so. But pity for the little one
      must have overtaken the poor mother at the last moment. She had put the
      babe in the rota of the hospital, and thus saved the child's life before
      carrying out her purpose upon her own."
    </p>
    <p>
      卡布奇諾僧侶低下頭，"妻子遺留的信中已給予他這麼多的瞭解。她本打算自己死的時候讓孩子也隨之結束生命，他原本也以為事情就是這樣了。但應該是在最後一刻，對小孩的憐憫戰勝了這位可憐的母親。她把寶寶放在了醫院的嬰兒投放窗口，因此在對自己的生命做出決定前，她救了孩子的生命。"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Capuchin crossed his knees, and one of his bare feet in its sandal
      showed from under the edge of his habit.
    </p>
    <p>
      這名卡皮修林修道士交叉著膝蓋，他的一隻赤腳從長袍的邊緣露了出來，腳上只穿著一雙涼鞋。

    <p>
      "We had baptized the boy by a name which the mother had written on a paper
      attached to his wrist, and the identity of that name with the name of the
      Noble Guard led to my revelation. Nature is a mighty thing, and on hearing
      what I told him the young brother became restless and unhappy. The
      instincts of the man began to fight with the<span

      feelings of the religious, and at last he left the friary in order to
      fulfil the duty which he thought he owed to his child."
    </p>
    <p>
      "我們已經根據母親在兒子手腕上附著的紙張所寫的名字，為這個男孩進行了洗禮，而這個名字與貴族衛隊的名字相同，這使我有了啟示。自然是一種偉大的力量，當我告訴他我們所發現的事情時，年輕的弟弟開始變得煩躁不安。人的本能開始和宗教的感情相抗衡，最後他決定離開修道院，以履行他認為欠缺的對他兒子的責任。"
    </p>
    <p>"He did not find him?"</p>
    <p>"他沒有找到他嗎？"</p>
    <p>
      "He was too late. According to custom, the boy had been put out to nurse
      on the Campagna, by means of the little dower that was all his inheritance
      from the State. His foster parents passed him over to other hands, and
      thus by the abuse of a good practice the child was already lost."
    </p>
    <p>
      "他已經來晚了。根據習俗，這個男孩被送到Campagna去撫養，這是他從國家繼承的一點點嫁妝。他的養父母將他移交給了其他人，因此，由於濫用良好的做法，這個孩子已經迷失了。"
    </p>
    <p>Roma tried to speak, but she could not utter a word.</p>
    <p>"羅馬試圖說話，但她無法發出一句話。"</p>
    <p>
      "What happened then is a long story. The old Baron was now dead and the
      young friar had inherited his princely fortune. Dispensations got over
      canonical difficulties, and in due course he took holy orders. His first
      work was to establish in Rome an asylum for friendless orphans. He went
      out into the streets to look for them, and brought them in with his own
      hands. His fame for charity grew rapidly, and he knew well what he was
      doing. He was looking for the little fatherless one who owned his own
      blood and bore his name."
    </p>
    <p>
      "然後發生的事情是一個長故事。老男爵現在已經去世，年輕的修道士繼承了他的王子般的財富。豁免規定解決了教會法律的困難，並且他適時地接受了聖職。他的第一項工作是在羅馬為無依無靠的孤兒建立一個收容所。他走進街頭去找他們，並親自把他們帶回來。他因慈善而迅速聞名，他知道自己在做什麼。他正在尋找那個擁有他自己血液，並帶著他名字的小孤兒。"
    </p>
    <p>
      Roma was now sitting with drooping head, and her tears were falling on her
      hands.

    <p>羅馬現在低著頭坐著，她的淚水正在滴落在她的雙手上。</p>
    <p>
      "Five years passed, and at length he came upon a trace of the boy and
      heard that he had been sent to England. The unhappy father obtained
      permission and removed to London. There he set up the same work as before
      and spent in the same way his great wealth. He passed five years more in a
      fruitless search, looking for his lost one day and night, winter and
      summer, in cold and heat, among the little foreign boys who play organs
      and accordions in the streets. Then he gave up hope and returned to Rome.
      His head was white and his heart was humble, but in spite of himself he
      rose from dignity to dignity until at length the old Baron's perverted
      ambitions were fulfilled. For his great and abounding charity, and still
      greater piety, he was promoted to be Bishop; seven years afterwards he was
      created Cardinal; and now he is Pope Pius the Tenth, the saint, the
      saviour of his people, once the storm-tossed, sorrowing, stricken man...."
    </p>
    <p>
      "五年過去了，他終於找到了那個男孩的蹤跡，聽說他被送去了英格蘭。不幸的父親得到許可後，搬到了倫敦。在那裡，他開始了與之前相同的工作，並以同樣的方式花費他的巨額財富。他又用了五年的時間去尋找他失敗的孩子，無論白天還是黑夜，無論是寒冬還是炎夏，他都在在街頭彈著風琴和手風琴的小外國男孩中尋找他。然後他放棄了希望，回到了羅馬。他的頭髮已變成白色，他的心變得謙卑，但是他不得不從尊嚴中起身，直到最後滿足了老男爵的過分的野心。因為他的大量慈善行為和更大的虔誠，他被提升為主教；七年後，他被建立為樞機主教；現在他是教宗皮烏斯十世，一位聖人，一位拯救他的人民的救世主，曾經是一位風暴中的、悲傷的、被打擊的人...."

    <p>"大衛·利昂"</p>

      "那位卡普奇林禮貌地鞠躬。"那是教皇的名字。他未犯過罪，也無需自我譴責，然而他明白什麼是起伏不定、承受痛苦並恢復堅強。告訴我，我女兒，有沒有什麼事情是你害怕向他透露的?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing! Nothing whatever!" said Roma, with tears choking her voice and
      streaming down her cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      "什麼也沒有！完全什麼也沒有！"羅馬說，聲音被淚水哽咽，眼淚順著她的臉頰流下來。

    <p>
      The door to the throne room opened again and a line of Cardinals came out
      and passed down the secret corridor, talking together as they walked, old
      men in violet, most of them very feeble and looking very tired. At the
      next moment the chaplain came in for Roma.

    <p>
      寶座廳的門再次開啟，一行紅衣主教走了出來，他們在秘密走廊中走過，一邊走一邊交談，他們都是身著紫色的老人，大多數都很虛弱，看上去也很疲憊。下一刻，牧師為羅馬進來了。
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Holy Father will be ready to receive you presently," he said in a
      hushed and reverent whisper, and she rose to follow him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "聖父很快就準備好接見你," 他以壓低而恭敬的聲音說道，於是她起身跟隨他。
    </p>
    <p>
      A moment later Roma was at the door of the grand throne room. A
      chamberlain took charge of her there, and passed her to a secret
      chamberlain at the door of an anteroom adjoining. This secret chamberlain
      handed her on to a Monsignor in a violet cassock, and the Monsignor
      accompanied her to the door of the room in which the Pope was sitting.
    </p>
    <p>
      片刻之後，羅馬來到了大寶座室的門前。一個侍衛在那裡接手她，並將她引導到與之相鄰的前室的門口的秘密侍衛處。這位秘密侍衛將她交給一位穿著紫色法衣的主教，並由主教陪同她走到教皇正在的房間的門口。
    </p>
    <p>
      "As you approach," he said in a low tone, "you will make three
      genuflexions—one at the door, another midway across the floor, the third
      at the Holy Father's feet. You feel well?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "當你接近時，"他低聲說，"你將做三次鞠躬：第一次在門口，第二次在地板的中間，第三次在聖父的腳前。你覺得良好嗎？"
    </p>
    <p>"Yes," she faltered.</p>
    <p>「是的，」她支吾了一句。</p>
    <p>
      The door was opened, the Monsignor stepped one pace into the room, and
      then knelt and said—
    </p>
    <p>門開了，主教走進房間一步，然後跪下來說-</p>
    <p>"Donna Roma Volonna, your Holiness."</p>
    <p>"羅馬伏洛那女士，你的神聖。"</p>
    <p>
      Roma was on her knees at the threshold; a soft, full, kindly voice, which
      she could have believed she had heard before, called on her to approach;
      she rose and stepped forward, the Monsignor stepped back, and the door
      behind her was closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      羅馬跪在門檻上;一個柔和、滿足、和藹的聲音叫她走近，她不禁認為她以前聽過這個聲音。她站起來邁步前進，樞機主教卻步後退，然後她身後的門關閉了。
    </p>
    <p>She was in the Presence.</p>
    <p>她在場。</p>
    <h3 id="pgepubid00390">III</h3>
    <p>
      The Pope, dressed wholly in white, was seated in a simple chair by a
      little table in a homely room, surrounded by bookcases and some busts of
      former pontiffs. There were little domesticities of intimate life about
      him, an empty soup-dish, a cruet-stand, a plate and a spoon. He had a<span
        class="x-ebookmaker-pageno"
        id="pgepubid00391"
        title="306"
        ><a id="Page_306" title="306"></a
      ></span>
      face of great sweetness and spirituality, and as Roma approached he bent
      his head and smiled a fatherly smile. She knelt and kissed his ring, and
      continued to kneel by his chair, putting one hand on the arm. He placed
      his own mittened hand over hers and patted it tenderly, while he looked
      into her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      教皇全身穿著白色的袍子，坐在一個簡單的椅子上，桌子旁邊是一個家常的房間，周圍是書櫃和一些前任教皇的半身像。他周圍有一些親密生活的小日常，如空的湯碗，調味品架，盤和湯匙。他有一張充滿甜美和靈性的臉，當羅馬走近時，他低頭並微笑著父親般的微笑。她跪下並親吻他的戒指，並繼續在他的椅子旁跪下，用一隻手放在扶手上。他將自己戴著手套的手放在她的手上，溫柔地拍拍，同時看著她的臉。
    </p>
    <p>
      The little nervous perturbation with which Roma had entered the room began
      to leave her, and in the awful wearer of the threefold crown she saw
      nothing but a simple, loving human being. A feminine sense crept over her,
      a sense of nursing, almost of motherhood, and at that first moment she
      felt as if she wanted to do something for the gentle old man. Then he
      began to speak. His voice had that tone which comes to the voice of a man
      who has the sense of sex strong in him, when a woman is with him and his
      accents soften perceptibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      當羅馬帶著一點小小的緊張進入房間時，這種感覺開始消失，而在這位三重皇冠的威嚴面容之下，她只看到了一個簡單而充滿愛的人。她覺得自己像個護士，幾乎到了母親的地步，那一刻她好像想要為這位溫和的老人做些什麼。然後他開始說話。他的聲音有著男性在女性面前，並且他的語調明顯變得柔和時所具有的那種感性的音調。
    </p>
    <p>
      "My daughter," he said, "Father Pifferi has spoken about you, and by your
      permission, as I understand it, he has repeated the story you told him.
      You have suffered, and you have my sympathy. And though you are not among
      the number of my children, I sent for you, that, as an old man to a young
      woman, by God's grace I might strengthen you and support you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "我的女兒，"他說，"皮菲瑞神父提起了您，且在您的許可下，他重述了您告訴他的故事。您曾遭受痛苦，我對此深感同情。雖然您並非我子女中的一員，我仍然打算見您，這是因為作為一名老人，我希望能借由上帝的恩典之下，支撐並堅強你。”
    </p>
    <p>
      She kissed his ring again and continued to kneel by the arm of his chair.
    </p>
    <p>她再次吻了他的戒指，並繼續跪在他的椅子旁邊。</p>
    <p>
      "Long ago, my child, I knew one who was in something like the same
      position, and perhaps it is the memory of what befell that poor soul which
      impels me to speak to you.... But she is dead, her story is dead too; let
      time and nature cover them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "很久以前，我的孩子，我知道一個處於類似情況的人，也許是我對那個可憐的靈魂所遭遇的事情的記憶促使我對你說話...但是她已經去世，她的故事也已經消亡;讓時間和自然覆蓋它們。"
    </p>
    <p>
      His voice had a slight tremor. She looked up. There was a hush, a
      momentary thrill. Then he smiled again and patted her hand once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      他的聲音微微顫抖。她抬起頭來。那時候有一種短暫的寧靜，瞬間的激動。然後他再次微笑，再次輕拍她的手。
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must not let the world weaken you, my child, or cause you to doubt
      the validity of your marriage. Whether it is a good marriage, in effect as
      well as intention (one of you being still unbaptized), it is for the
      Church, not the world, to decide."
    </p>
    <p>
      "你不能讓世界削弱你，我的孩子，或讓你對你的婚姻的有效性產生懷疑。無論這是一個好的婚姻，無論從實際還是意圖（你們中的一個仍未受洗），這都是由教會來決定的，而不是世界。"
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Roma kissed the ring of the Pope, and again he patted the hand that
      lay under his.
    </p>
    <p>"羅馬再一次吻了教皇的戒指，他再次輕拍躺在他下面的那隻手。"</p>
    <p>
      "Nevertheless, there is something I wish you to do, my daughter," he said,
      in the same low tones. "I wish you to tell your husband."<span

    </p>
    <p>
      "然而，我女兒，我還是希望你做一件事，"他低聲說，"我希望你告訴你的丈夫。"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Holy Father," said Roma, "I have already told him. I had done so before I
      spoke to Father Pifferi, but only under the disguise of another woman's
      story."
    </p>
    <p>
      "聖父，"
      羅馬說，"我已經告訴他了。在我跟Pifferi神父對話之前，我已經在講述另一個女人的故事的偽裝下這樣做了。"
    </p>
    <p>"And what did your husband say?"</p>
    <p>"那麼，你的丈夫說了什麼？"</p>
    <p>
      "He said what your Holiness says. He was very charitable and noble; so I
      took heart and told him everything."
    </p>
    <p>
      "他說了你的聖潔所說的。他非常慷慨和高尚；所以我鼓起勇氣，告訴他所有的事情。"
    </p>
    <p>"And what did he say then?"</p>
    <p>"那他後來說了什麼呢？"</p>
    <p>
      A cloud crossed her face. "Holy Father, he has not yet said anything."
    </p>
    <p>雲彩掠過她的臉。"聖父，他還沒有說任何事呢。"</p>
    <p>"Not anything?"</p>
    <p>"什麼都沒有？"</p>
    <p>"He is away; he has not replied to my letter."</p>
    <p>"他不在；他沒有回覆我的信。"</p>
    <p>"Has there been time?"</p>
    <p>"有沒有時間？"</p>
    <p>"More than time, your Holiness, but still I hear nothing."</p>
    <p>"除了時間的流逝，您的聖潔，我仍然什麼都沒有聽到。"</p>
    <p>"And what is your conclusion?"</p>
    <p>"那麼，你的結論是什麼?"</p>
    <p>
      "That my letter has awakened some pity, but now that he knows <i>I</i> am
      the wife I spoke about and <i>he</i> is the husband intended, he cannot
      forgive me as he said the husband would forgive, and his generous soul is
      in distress."
    </p>
    <p>
      "我的信件引起了他的同情，但現在他知道了我就是我提到的那個妻子，他就是那個被提到的丈夫，他無法像他說的那樣原諒我，他那慷慨的心靈現在正感到痛苦。"
    </p>
    <p>"My daughter, could you wish me to speak to him?"</p>
    <p>"我的女兒，你希望我跟他說話嗎？"</p>
    <p>
      The cloud fled from her face. "It is more than I deserve, far more, but if
      the Holy Father would do that...."
    </p>
    <p>
      "雲從她的臉上飄然而去。
      "這超出了我應得的，遠超出了，但如果神聖的父親願意那樣做...."
    </p>
    <p>"Then I must know the names—you must tell me everything."</p>
    <p>"那我必須知道名字 - 你必須告訴我一切。"</p>
    <p>"Yes, yes!"</p>
    <p>"是的，是的！"</p>
    <p>"Who is your father, my child?"</p>
    <p>"你的父親是誰，我的孩子？"</p>
    <p>
      "My father died in banishment. He was a Liberal—he was Prince Prospero
      Volonna."
    </p>
    <p>"我的父親在流放中去世。他是個自由主義者——他是普洛斯佩羅·沃隆納王子。"</p>
    <p>"As I thought. Who was the other man?"</p>
    <p>"正如我所想。那另一個男人是誰？"</p>
    <p>
      "He was a distant kinsman of my father's, and I have lately discovered
      that he was the principal instrument in my father's deportation. He was my
      guardian, a Minister and a great man in Italy. It is the Baron Bonelli,
      your Holiness."
    </p>
    <p>
      "他是我父親的遠房親戚，我最近發現他是我父親被驅逐出境的主要幕後推手。他曾是我的監護人，是義大利的一位部長和大人物。他就是您的聖人，那位奔奈利男爵。"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just so, just so!" said the Pope, tapping his foot in obvious heat. "But
      go on, my child. Who is your husband?"
    </p>
    <p>
      “就是這樣，就是這樣！”教皇說，顯然有些焦躁地踏著腳。”但繼續，我的孩子。你的丈夫是誰？”
    </p>
    <p>"My husband is a different kind of man altogether."</p>
    <p>"我的丈夫完全是一種不同的人。"</p>
    <p>"Ah!"</p>
    <p>"啊！"</p>
    <p>
      "He has done everything for me, Holy Father—everything. Heaven knows what
      I should have been now without him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "他為我做了一切，聖父--一切事情。
      上天知道，如果沒有他，我現在會變成什麼樣子。"
    </p>
    <p>"God bless him! God bless both of you!"</p>
    <p>"神保佑他！神保佑你們倆！"</p>
    <p>
      "I came to know him by the strangest accident. He is a<span
        class="x-ebookmaker-pageno"
        id="pgepubid00393"
        title="308"

      ></span>
      Liberal too, and a Deputy, and thinking of the corruptions of the
      Government, he pointed to me as the mistress of the Minister. It was not
      true, but I was degraded, and ... and I set out to destroy him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "我透過最奇怪的意外認識了他。他也是一個自由主義者，並且是議員，在想到政府的腐敗時，他指我是部長的情婦。這不是事實，但我受到了侮辱，...我開始著手摧毀他。"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A terrible vengeance, my child. Only the Minister could have thought of
      it."
    </p>
    <p>"可怕的復仇，我的孩子。只有部長能想得出來。"</p>
    <p>
      "Then I found that my enemy was one of my father's friends, and a true and
      noble man. Holy Father, I had begun in hate, but I could not hate him. The
      darkness faded away from my soul, and something bright and beautiful came
      in its place. I loved him, and he loved me. With all our hearts we loved
      each other."
    </p>
    <p>
      "然後我發現我的敵人是我父親的朋友，且是一個真誠和高尚的人。神聖的父親，我是憎恨他開始的，但我無法恨他。黑暗從我的靈魂中消退，而某種明亮和美麗的東西取而代之。我愛他，他也愛我。我們全心全意地愛著彼此。"
    </p>
    <p>"And then?"</p>
    <p>"那麼呢?"</p>
    <p>
      "Then <i>he</i> came back to me. I knew all the secrets I had set out to
      learn, but I could not give them up, and when I refused he threatened me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "然後他回到了我身邊。我知道我要學習的所有秘密，但我不能放棄它們，當我拒絕時，他威脅我。"
    </p>
    <p>"And what did you do?"</p>
    <p>「你做了什麼？」</p>
    <p>
      "I married my husband and withstood every temptation. It wasn't so very
      hard, for I cared nothing for wealth and luxury now. I only wanted to be
      good. God Himself should see how good I could be."
    </p>
    <p>
      "我嫁給了我的丈夫，抵擋住了每一種誘惑。這並不太難，因為我現在對財富和奢侈生活並沒有任何興趣。我只想做一個好人。上帝自己應該看看我能有多麼善良。"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Pope's eyes were moist. He was patting the young woman's trembling
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>教宗的眼睛潤濕了。他輕輕地拍著那位年輕女子顫抖的手。</p>
    <p>
      "My blessing rest on you, my daughter, and may the man you have married be
      worthy of your love and trust."
    </p>
    <p>"願我的祝福降臨在你身上，我的女兒，願你所嫁之人配得上你的愛與信任。"</p>
    <p>"Indeed, indeed he is," said Roma.</p>
    <p>"確實，他確實是，" 羅馬說。</p>
    <p>"He was your father's friend, you tell me?"</p>
    <p>"他是你父親的朋友，是你告訴我的嗎？"</p>
    <p>
      "Yes, your Holiness, and although we met again so recently, I had known
      him in England when I was a child."
    </p>
    <p>"是的，您的神聖，儘管我們剛剛相見，但我在英國的時候就認識了他。"</p>
    <p>"A Liberal, you say?"</p>
    <p>"你說你是自由派？"</p>
    <p>"Yes, your Holiness."</p>
    <p>"是的，閣下的神聖。"</p>
    <p>"The enmity of the Minister was the fruit of political warfare?"</p>
    <p>"部長的敵意是政治鬥爭的果實?"</p>
    <p>"Nothing but that at first, though now...."</p>
    <p>"起初只是那樣，雖然現在...."</p>
    <p>"I see, I see. And the secrets you speak of are only...."</p>
    <p>"我明白，我明白。而你所說的秘密只是...."</p>
    <p>"Only the doings of twenty years ago, which are dead and done with."</p>
    <p>"只是二十年前的事，那些都已成為過去了。"</p>
    <p>"Then your husband is older than you are?"</p>
    <p>"那麼你的丈夫比你年長嗎？"</p>
    <p>The young woman broke into a sunny smile, which set the Pope smiling.</p>
    <p>那位年輕女子綻放出陽光般的笑容，這使得教皇也笑了起來。</p>
    <p>"Only ten years older, your Holiness. He is thirty-four."</p>
    <p>"神聖的，他只大我十歲。他今年34歲。"</p>

    <p>"他看起來是什麼樣子的？"</p>

      "He is like ... I have never seen any one so like ... will your Holiness
      forgive me?"

    <p>"他就像...我從未見過如此相似的...請原諒我，您的聖潔嗎？"</p>
    <p>
      The colour had mounted to her eyes, her two rows of pearly teeth seemed to
      be smiling, and the sunny old face of the Pope was smiling too.
    </p>
    <p>
      顏色已經上升到她的眼睛，她的兩排珍珠般的牙齒似乎在笑，而教皇那陽光般的老臉也在笑。

    <p>"Say what you please, my daughter."</p>
    <p>"隨你說，我的女兒。"</p>
    <p>"I have never seen any one so like the Holy Father," she said softly.</p>
    <p>"我從未見過有人如此像神聖的父親，"她輕聲說。</p>
    <p>
      Her head was held down and there was a little nervous tremor at her heart.
      The Pope patted her hand affectionately.
    </p>
    <p>她低下了頭，心中有一絲緊張的震動。教皇慈愛地拍了拍她的手。</p>
    <p>"Have I asked you his name, my child?"</p>
    <p>"我有問過你他的名字了嗎，我的孩子？"</p>
    <p>"His name is David Rossi."</p>
    <p>他的名字是大衛·羅西。</p>
    <p>
      The Pope rose suddenly from his seat, and for the first time his face
      looked dark and troubled.
    </p>
    <p>教皇突然從座位上站起來，他的臉色第一次顯得陰沉困憔。</p>
    <p>"David Rossi?" he repeated in a husky voice.</p>
    <p>"大衛·羅西？"他以嘶啞的聲音重複說。</p>
    <p>Roma began to tremble. "Yes," she faltered.</p>
    <p>"羅馬開始顫抖。"對，"她結結巴巴的說。</p>
    <p>"David Rossi, the Revolutionary?"</p>
    <p>"大衛·羅西，革命者？"</p>
    <p>"Indeed no, your Holiness, he is not that."</p>
    <p>"確實不是，您的神聖，他不是那個。"</p>
    <p>
      "But, my child, my child, he is the founder of a revolutionary society
      which this very day the Holy Father has condemned."
    </p>
    <p>
      "但是，我的孩子，我的孩子，他是一個革命社會的創始人，就在今天，教宗已經譴責了他。"
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked across the room and she rose to her feet and looked after him.
    </p>
    <p>他走過了房間，她站起來看著他的背影。</p>
    <p>
      "One of the men who are conspiring against the peace of the Church—banded
      together to fight the Church and its head."
    </p>
    <p>"有一些人聯合起來，陰謀破壞教會的和平-結盟對抗教會及其領袖。"</p>
    <p>
      "Don't say that, your Holiness. He is religious, deeply religious, and far
      more an enemy of the Government and the King."
    </p>
    <p>
      "不要這麼說，尊敬的聖偉。他是宗教的，深度的宗教，並且比政府和國王的敵人更多。"
    </p>
    <p>
      She began to talk wildly, almost aimlessly, trying to defend Rossi at all
      costs.
    </p>
    <p>她開始瘋狂地，幾乎無目的地說話，試圖不惜一切代價捍衛羅西。</p>
    <p>
      "Holy Father," she said, "shall I tell you a secret? There is nobody else
      in the world to whom I could tell it, but I can tell it to you. My husband
      is now in England organising a great scheme among the exiles and refugees
      of Italy. What it is I don't know, but he has told me that it will lead to
      the conquest of the country and the downfall of the throne. Whether it is
      to be a conspiracy in the ordinary sense, or a constitutional plan of
      campaign, he has not said, but everything tells me that it is directed
      against the politics<span

      of Rome, and not against its religion, and is intended to overthrow the
      King, and not the Pope."
    </p>
    <p>
      "聖父，"她說，"我可以告訴你一個秘密嗎？除了您，世界上沒有其他人我可以告訴了。我的丈夫現在在英國，在義大利的流亡者和難民中組織一個大型計劃。我不知道那是什麼，但他告訴我，這會導致對國家的征服和王位的垮臺。我不清楚是否將以普通意義上的陰謀，或是個憲法式的戰役計劃來進行，但所有事情告訴我，這是針對羅馬的政治，而不是其宗教，旨在推翻國王，而非教皇的。"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Pope, who had been standing with his back to Roma, turned round to her
      with a look of fright. His eyebrows had met over the vertical lines on his
      forehead, and this further reminder of another face threw Roma into still
      greater confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      教宗一直背對著羅馬站著，他驚恐地轉過身來看著她。他的眉毛在他額頭的垂直線上相遇，這更多的提醒使羅馬陷入了更大的困惑。
    </p>
    <p>
      "'When I come back, it will be with such a force behind me as will make
      the prisons open their doors and the thrones of tyrants tremble.' That's
      what he said, your Holiness. The movement will come soon, too, I am sure
      it will, and then your Holiness will see that, instead of being
      irreligious men, the leaders of the people...."

      "'當我回來時，背後將有如此強大的力量，足以使監獄敞開大門，暴君的王座震顫。'
      這就是他說的，您的聖潔。很快，運動就會來臨，我確信會的，然後您的聖潔將會看到，民眾的領導者，他們並非不敬神的人...."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Pope held up his hand. "Stop!" he cried. "Say no more, my child. God
      knows what I must do with what you have said already."
    </p>
    <p>
      教宗舉起手來。“停！”他喊道。“不要再說了，我的孩子。上帝知道我該怎麼處理你已經說過的話。”
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Roma saw what she had done in the wild gust of her emotion, and in
      her terror she tried to take it back.
    </p>
    <p>
      然後，羅馬看到她在情緒的狂風中做了什麼，並且在她的恐慌中，她試圖收回。
    </p>
    <p>
      "Holy Father, you must not think from what I say that David Rossi is for
      revolution and regicide...."
    </p>
    <p>"聖父，您絕不能從我所說的中認為大衛·羅西支援革命和篡位......"</p>
    <p>
      "Don't speak, my child. You cannot know what an earthquake you have opened
      at my feet. Let me think!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "不要說話，我的孩子。你不可能知道你在我腳下開啟了多大的地震。讓我想想！"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was silence for a moment, and then Roma gulped down the great lumps
      in her throat and said: "I am only an ignorant woman, Holy Father, and
      perhaps I have said too much, and do not understand. But what I have told
      your Holiness was told me in love and confidence. And the Holy Father is
      wise and good, and whatever he does will be for the best."
    </p>
    <p>
      片刻的寂靜過後，羅馬勉強壓下喉嚨中的大塊哽咽，然後她說：“我只是一個無知的女人，聖父，也許我說得太多，也不理解。但是我對您的聖認所說的都是別人憑愛與信任告訴我的。聖父是明智且善良的，他做的一切都將是最好的。”
    </p>
    <p>
      The Pope returned to his chair with a bewildered look, and did not seem to
      hear. Roma sank to her knees by his side and said in a low, pleading tone:
    </p>
    <p>
      教宗帶著困惑的神情返回到他的座位上，似乎沒有聽到。羅馬人跪在他的身邊，低聲懇求地說：
    </p>
    <p>
      "My husband's faith in me is so beautiful, your Holiness. Oh, so
      beautiful. I am the only one in the world to whom he has told all his
      secrets, and if any of them should ever come back to him...."
    </p>
    <p>
      "我的丈夫對我如此深信，您的聖潔。哦，太美妙了。我是世界上唯一一個他全部秘密都告訴過的人，如果有任何秘密被人揭穿回到他那裡...."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't be afraid, my daughter. What you said in simple confidence shall be
      as sacred as if it had been spoken under the seal of the confessional."
    </p>
    <p>
      "別怕，我的女兒。你所簡單地誠實表白的話，將會像在告解時誓言一樣神聖。"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I could tell your Holiness more about him—who he is and where he comes
      from—a place so lowly and humble, your Holiness...."
    </p>
    <p>
      "如果我能告訴您的聖潔更多關於他的資訊——他是誰以及他從何處來——一個如此卑微和謙遜的地方，您的聖潔...."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell me no more, my child. It is better I should not<span

      know. Pity ought to have no place in what duty tells me to do. But I can
      love David Rossi for all that. I do love him. I love him as a lost and
      wayward son, whose hand is raised against his Father, though he knows it
      not."
    </p>
    <p>
      "不要再告訴我了，我的孩子。最好我不知道。同情應該在職責告訴我該做什麼的時候沒有位置。但是儘管如此，我能愛David
      Rossi。我確實愛他。我把他當作一個迷失和越軌的兒子愛著，他的手反抗他的父親，儘管他並不知道。"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a bell button on the Pope's chair. He pressed it, and the
      Participante returned to the room without knocking. The Pope rose and took
      Roma's hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      教皇的座椅上有個鈴鐺按鈕。他按下它，參賽者沒有敲門就回到了房間。教皇站起來並握住了羅馬的手。
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go in peace and with my blessing, my child. I bless you! May my fatherly
      blessing keep you pure in heart, may it strengthen you in all temptations,
      comfort you in all trials, avert from you every evil omen, and bring you
      into the fold of Christ's children at the last."
    </p>
    <p>
      "去吧，我的孩子，在和平與我祝福的陪伴下。我祝福你！願我的父親的祝福讓你心淨如初，它能在所有的誘惑中堅固你，為你在所有困苦中帶來慰藉，為你避開所有的邪惡預兆，並在最後帶你進入基督的孩子團體。"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Participante stepped forward and signed to Roma to withdraw. She rose
      and left the presence chamber, stepping backward and too much moved to
      speak. Not until the door had been closed did she realise that she was
      crossing the throne room, and that the Bussolante was walking beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
      參加者向前走去，並且示意羅馬撤退。她起身離開了王座大廳，向後退去，感動得無法說話。直到門關閉，她才意識到她正在穿越王座房間，並且Bussolante正在她身邊行走。
    </p>
    <h3 id="pgepubid00397">IV</h3>
    <p>
      When the Pope walked in his garden that afternoon as usual, the old
      Capuchin was with him. From the door of the Vatican they drove in the
      Pope's landau with two of the Noble Guard riding beside the carriage, and
      one of the chamberlains walking behind it, through lanes enshrouded in
      laurel and ilex, until they reached the summer-house on the top of the
      hill. There the old men stepped down, the Pope in his white cassock, white
      overcoat and red hat, the Capuchin in his brown habit, skull-cap and
      sandals. The Pope's cat, a creature of reddish coat, which followed him
      into the garden as a dog follows his master, leapt out of the carriage
      after them.
    </p>
    <p>
      當教宗那天下午像往常一樣在他的花園中散步時，與他同行的是一位老卡普奇諾修士。他們從梵蒂岡的門口乘坐教宗的馬車出發，兩名貴族衛隊騎士在馬車旁邊騎行，一名侍從在馬車後面走路，穿過被月桂和冬青環抱的小徑，直到他們到達山頂上的夏日小屋。然後老人們下車，教宗穿著他的白色長袍，白色大衣和紅帽，卡普奇諾修士穿著他的棕色長袍，頭巾和涼鞋。教宗的貓，一隻紅色的生物，跟隨他走進花園就像狗跟隨主人一樣，也從馬車後跳了出來。
    </p>
    <p>
      The Pope was more than usually grave and silent. Once or twice the
      Capuchin said, "And how did you find my young penitent this morning?"
    </p>
    <p>
      教皇今天比平時更加嚴肅而沉默。卡布奇諾神父一兩次問道：“今天早上你覺得我那年輕的懺悔者如何？”
    </p>
    <p>"<i>Bene, bene!</i>" the Pope replied.</p>
    <p>"好的，好的！"教皇回答。</p>
    <p>
      But at length the Pope, scraping the gravel at his feet with the ferrule
      of his walking-stick, began to speak on his own initiative.
    </p>
    <p>但最終，教皇開始主動發言，他用手杖的鐵箍刮著腳下的砂礫。</p>
    <p>"Father!"</p>
    <p>"父親!"</p>
    <p>"Your Holiness?"</p>
    <p>"尊貴的聖人?"</p>
    <p>
      "The inscrutable decree of God which made me your Pontiff has not altered
      our relations to each other as men?"<span

    </p>
    <p>
      "神秘的上帝旨意讓我成為你們的教皇，這並未改變我們作為人類之間的關係。"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Capuchin took snuff and answered, "Your Holiness is always so good as
      to say so."
    </p>
    <p>這個卡普錫恩修道士呷了一口煙，然後回答說，“陛下總是如此慈祥。”</p>
    <p>
      "You are my master now just as you were thirty years ago, and there is
      something I wish to ask of you."
    </p>
    <p>"你現在仍然是我的主人，就像三十年前一樣，我有些事想問你。"</p>
    <p>"What is it, your Holiness?"</p>
    <p>"尊敬的教宗，有什麼事嗎？"</p>
    <p>"You have been a confessor many years, Father?"</p>
    <p>"您當神父好多年了，對嗎？"</p>
    <p>"Forty years, your Holiness."</p>
    <p>"四十年，閣下的神聖。"</p>
    <p>"In that time you have had many difficult cases?"</p>
    <p>"在那段時間裡，你遇到了許多困難的案子嗎？"</p>
    <p>"Very many."</p>
    <p>"非常多。"</p>
    <p>
      "Father, has it ever happened that a penitent, has revealed to you a
      conspiracy to commit a crime?"
    </p>
    <p>"父親，有沒有過這樣的情況 - 一名懺悔者向你揭示了一個犯罪的陰謀?"</p>
    <p>"More than once it has happened."</p>
    <p>"這已經不止一次發生了。"</p>
    <p>"And what have you done?"</p>
    <p>"你做了什麼？"</p>
    <p>
      "Persuaded him to reveal it to the civil authorities, or else tell it to
      me outside the confessional."
    </p>
    <p>"說服他向公民當局揭示，或者在告解之外告訴我。"</p>
    <p>"Has the penitent ever refused to do so?"</p>
    <p>"悔罪者有沒有拒絕過這樣做？"</p>
    <p>"Never."</p>
    <p>"永不"</p>
    <p>
      "But if ... if the case were such as made it difficult for the penitent to
      reveal the conspiracy to the civil authorities, having regard to the
      penalties the revelation would bring with it ... if by reason of ties of
      blood and affection such revelation were humanly impossible, and it would
      even be cruel to ask for it, what would you do then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "但如果...如果情況讓悔罪者難以向民事當局揭露陰謀，考慮到揭露會帶來的懲罰...如果由於血緣和感情的關係，這種揭露在人性上是不可能的，甚至要求它會是殘酷的，那您會怎麼做呢?"
    </p>
    <p>"Nothing, your Holiness."</p>
    <p>"沒有什麼，神聖的。"</p>
    <p>
      "Not even if the crime to be committed were a serious one, and it touched
      you very nearly?"
    </p>
    <p>"即使即將犯下的罪行是嚴重的，並且與你息息相關，你也不會介意嗎？"</p>
    <p>
      The Capuchin shook out his coloured print handkerchief and said, "That
      could make no difference, your Holiness."
    </p>
    <p>
      那個卡普奇諾修道士搖出他的彩色印花手帕，並說，“這不會有任何差別，閣下。”
    </p>
    <p>
      "But suppose you heard in confession that your brother is to be
      assassinated, what is your duty?"
    </p>
    <p>"但假設你在告解中聽到你的兄弟將要被暗殺，你的責任是什麼？”</p>
    <p>
      "My duty to the penitent who reveals his soul to me is to preserve his
      secret."
    </p>
    <p>"我對向我揭示靈魂的悔者的職責是保護他的秘密。"</p>
    <p>"And what is your duty to God?"</p>
    <p>"那麼，你對上帝的責任是什麼？"</p>
    <p>The handkerchief dropped from the Capuchin's hand.</p>
    <p>這頂手帕從Capuchin的手中掉了下來。</p>
    <p>
      The Pope paused, scraped the gravel with the ferrule of his stick, and
      said:
    </p>
    <p>教皇停下來，用他手杖的鐵環刮著砂石，然後說:</p>
    <p>
      "Father, I am in the position of the confessor who has guilty knowledge of
      a conspiracy against the life of his enemy."
    </p>
    <p>"父親，我就像知罪者一樣，對於一項針對他的敵人的陰謀有所知情。"</p>
    <p>
      The Capuchin pushed his handkerchief into his sleeve and dropped back into
      his seat. After a moment the Pope told the story of what Roma had said of
      Rossi's plans abroad.
    </p>
    <p>
      卡普其恩將手帕塞入袖子中，然後退回座位上。過了一會，教皇敘述了羅馬關於羅西在國外計劃的說法。
    </p>
    <p>
      "A conspiracy," he said, "plainly a conspiracy."<span
        class="x-ebookmaker-pageno"
        id="pgepubid00399"
        title="313"
        ><a id="Page_313" title="313"></a
      ></span>
    </p>
    <p>"這明顯是一種陰謀，"他說。</p>
    <p>"And what do you understand the conspiracy to be?"</p>
    <p>"那你對陰謀的理解是什麼?"</p>
    <p>
      "Who can say? Perhaps a recurrence to the custom of the Middle Ages, when
      citizens who had been banished by their opponents used to apply themselves
      in exile to attempt the reconquest of their country by stirring up the
      factions at home."
    </p>
    <p>
      "誰能說得清楚？也許是回到中世紀的習慣，當時被對手驅逐的公民會在流亡中致力於試圖透過煽動國內的派系來重新徵服他們的國家。"
    </p>
    <p>"You think that is Rossi's object?"</p>
    <p>"你認為那是羅西的目標嗎？"</p>
    <p>"I do."</p>
    <p>"我願意。"</p>
    <p>The Capuchin shifted uneasily the skull-cap on his crown and said:</p>
    <p>這名Capuchin修士不安地在他的頂上擺動骷髏帽，他說：</p>
    <p>"Holy Father, I trust your Holiness will leave the matter alone."</p>
    <p>"聖父，我相信您的神聖會放下這件事。"</p>
    <p>"Why so?"</p>
    <p>"為什麼這樣?"</p>
    <p>
      "In reading history I do not find that such enterprises have usually been
      successful. I see, rather, how commonly they have failed. And if it was so
      in the Middle Ages when the arts of war were primitive, how much less
      likely are the conspiracies of secret societies, the partial and
      superficial risings of refugees, to be serious now in the days of standing
      armies."
    </p>
    <p>
      在閱讀歷史時，我並未發現此類事業通常能夠成功。相反，我看到它們多麼常常失敗。如果在戰爭藝術還處於原始狀態的中世紀，這種情況就已經如此，那麼在現今擁有常備軍隊的時代，秘密社團的陰謀、難民的部分和表面的起義又如何可能變得嚴重呢？
    </p>
    <p>"True. But is that a good reason for doing nothing in this instance?"</p>
    <p>"對。但這是在這種情況下什麼都不做的好理由嗎？"</p>
    <p>
      "But, Holy Father, think. You cannot disclose the secrets this poor lady
      has revealed to you. Her confession was only a confidence, but your
      Holiness knows well that there is such a thing as a natural secret which
      it would be a great fault to reveal. Facts which of their own nature are
      confidential belong to this order. They are assimilated to the
      confessional, and as such they should be respected."
    </p>
    <p>
      "但是，聖父，您得想想。您不能透露這位可憐的女士向您表露的秘密。她的告解只是一種信任，但是您的聖潔知道，自然界中有一種秘密，如果被揭示出來，那將是一個很大的錯誤。本質上具有保密性質的事實屬於此類。他們被視為口供，並因此應該得到尊重。"
    </p>
    <p>"Indeed they should."</p>
    <p>"確實他們應該。"</p>
    <p>
      "Then it is not possible for your Holiness to reveal what you heard this
      morning without bringing trouble to the penitent and wronging her in
      relation to her husband."
    </p>
    <p>
      "那麼，您的聖潔不可能揭示您今天早上聽到的事情，而不對悔罪者造成困擾，並對她和她的丈夫不公。"
    </p>
    <p>
      "God forbid that I should do so, whatever happens. But is a priest
      forbidden to speak of a sin heard in confession if he can do so in such a
      way that the identity of the penitent cannot be discovered?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "但願我不會這麼做，無論發生什麼事。但是，如果一個神父能以某種方式談論在告解中聽到的罪行，而又不會被發現是誰的懺悔者的身份，那麼他被禁止談論這種罪行嗎？"
    </p>
    <p>"Your Holiness intends to do that?"</p>
    <p>"您的聖潔打算那樣做嗎？"</p>
    <p>"Why not?"</p>
    <p>為什麼不呢？</p>
    <p>
      "The Holy Father knows best. For my own part, your Holiness, I think it a
      danger to tamper with the secrets of a soul, whatever the good end in view
      or the evil to be prevented."<span

      ></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      "聖父是最明智的。就我個人來說，您的聖潔，我認為揭開靈魂秘密是危險的，無論出於何種良好目的，或者要防止的惡行。"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Capuchin looked round to where the horses were pawing the path and the
      Guards stood by the carriage.
    </p>
    <p>這位卡普奇修士看向馬蹄踏踩小徑的地方，以及衛士們站在馬車旁的景象。</p>
    <p>
      "Thirty-five years ago we had a terrible lesson in such dangers, your
      Holiness."
    </p>
    <p>"三十五年前，我們在這樣的危險中經歷了一次可怕的教訓，您的聖潔。"</p>
    <p>The Pope dropped his head and continued to scrape the gravel.</p>
    <p>教皇低下頭，繼續在碎石上刨。</p>
    <p>
      "Your Holiness remembers the poor young woman who told her confessor she
      was about to marry a rich young man. The confessor thought it his duty to
      tell the young man's father in general terms that such a marriage was to
      be contracted. What was the result? The marriage took place in secret and
      ended in grief and death."
    </p>
    <p>
      "您的聖潔還記得那位貧窮的年輕女子對她的告解神父說，她即將嫁給一位富有的年輕男子。告解神父認為有責任向年輕男子的父親大致說明此類婚姻將要訂立。結果如何呢？這場婚禮秘密舉行，最終以悲劇和死亡作結。"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Pope rose uneasily. "We will not speak of that. It was a case of a
      father's pride and perverted ambition. This is a different case
      altogether. A man who is a prey to diabolical illusions, an enemy of the
      Church and of social order, is hatching a plot which can only end in
      mischief and bloodshed. The Holy Father knows it. Shall he keep this
      guilty knowledge locked in his own bosom? God forbid!"
    </p>
    <p>
      教宗不安地站了起來。"我們不談那件事。那只是一個父親的自豪和扭曲的野心。這是一種完全不同的情況。一個受惡魔幻覺影響的人，敵視教會和社會秩序，正在策劃一個只會以禍亂和流血告終的陰謀。神聖的教宗知道這一切。他應該將這個有罪的知識鎖在自己的胸膛裡嗎？絕不應該！"
    </p>
    <p>"Then you intend to warn the civil authorities?"</p>
    <p>"那你打算警告民事當局嗎？"</p>
    <p>
      "I must. It is my duty. How could I lay my head on my pillow and not do
      it? But I will do it discreetly. I will commit no one, and this poor lady
      shall remain unknown."
    </p>
    <p>
      "我必須這麼做，這是我的責任。我怎麼能躺在枕頭上而不去做呢？但我會謹慎地去做，我不會涉及任何人，這位可憐的女士將會不為人知。"
    </p>
    <p>
      The venerable old men, each leaning on his stick, walked down a path lined
      by clipped yews, shaded by cypresses, and almost overgrown with crocus,
      anemone, and violet. Suddenly from the bushes there came a flutter of
      wings, followed by the scream of a bird, and in a moment the Pope's cat
      had leapt on to a marble which stood in the midst of the jungle. It was an
      ancient sarcophagus, placed there as a fountain, but the spring that had
      fed it was dry, and in its moss-grown mouth a bird had made its nest. The
      cat was about to pounce down on the eggs when the Pope laid hold of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      `那些可敬的老人，每人都倚著他的柺杖，走下一個被修剪整齊的紫杉林夾道，由松柏遮蔽，幾乎被藏紅花，銀蓮花和紫羅蘭蔓延得滿目翠綠。突然，從叢中飛出一陣翅膀的撲撲聲，接著是一隻鳥的尖叫聲，瞬間，教皇的貓就跳到了叢林中央的一塊大理石上。那是一個古老的石棺，被當作噴泉放在那裡，但餵它的春水已經乾涸，鳥在其長滿苔蘚的口中築了巢。貓正要撲向鳥蛋，這時教皇抓住了它。`
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, Meesh, Meesh," he said, "what an anarchist you are, to be sure!...
      Monsignor!"
    </p>
    <p>"啊，米什，米什，"他說，"你確實是個無政府主義者！... 主教！"</p>
    <p>"Yes, your Holiness," said the chamberlain, coming up behind.</p>
    <p>"是的，聖潔的領袖，"侍從走上前來說。</p>
    <p>
      "Take this <i>gatto rosso</i> back to the carriage, and keep him in
      <i>domicilio coatto</i> until we come."
    </p>
    <p>"把這隻紅色的貓帶回馬車，並將它留在強制性住所，直到我們回來。"</p>
    <p>
      The Monsignor laughed and carried off the cat, and the Pope put his
      mittened hand gently on the little speckled eggs.
    </p>
    <p>
      教區長閣下笑了起來，帶走了那隻貓，而教皇則用他戴著手套的手輕輕地摸了摸那些小斑點的雞蛋。
    </p>
    <p>

      "可憐的小東西！它們都是暖的。聽！那是樹上的母鳥在尖叫。聽著！她正在看著我們，等待我們離開。她多麼安心地以為她的秘密被保護得很好。"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Capuchin drew a long breath. "Yes, nature has the same cry for fear in
      all her offspring."
    </p>
    <p>
      這個加布洛雕像長長的吸了一口氣，說道："是的，自然之母對所有子女的恐懼吶喊是相同的。"
    </p>
    <p>"True," said the Pope.</p>
    <p>"確實如此，"教皇說。</p>
    <p>"It makes me think of that poor girl this morning."</p>
    <p>"這讓我想起今早那個可憐的女孩。"</p>
    <p>
      The Pope walked back to the carriage without saying a word. As he returned
      to the Vatican, the Angelus was ringing from all the church bells of Rome,
      the city was bathed in crimson light, the sun was sinking behind Monte
      Mario, and the stone pines on the crest of the hill, standing out against
      the reddening sky, were like the roofless columns of a ruined temple.
    </p>
    <p>
      教皇沒有說一句話就走回馬車。當他回到梵蒂岡時，羅馬的所有教堂鐘聲中都在響起天使誦讀的聲音，全城沐浴在深紅的光中，太陽正在蒙特·馬里奧山後面沉下，山頂上的石松，在泛紅的天空中突出，就像一座無頂的廢棄寺廟的柱子。

    <p>
      Next day Francesca came up with a letter. The porter from Trinità de'
      Monti had brought it and he was waiting below for a present. In a kind of
      momentary delirium Roma snatched at the envelope and emptied her purse
      into the old woman's hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      隔天，弗朗西斯卡帶著一封信來了。這是特立尼塔山的門房送來的，他正在下面等待禮物。羅馬在一種短暫的狂熱中搶過信封，並將錢包裡的錢倒進了老婦人的手中。
    </p>
    <p>"Santo Dio!" cried Francesca, "all this for a letter?"</p>
    <p>"天哪！"弗朗西斯卡喊道，"所有這一切只是為了一封信嗎？"</p>
    <p>
      "Never mind, godmother," said Roma. "Give the money to the good man and
      let him go."
    </p>
    <p>"沒關係，教母，" 羅馬說。 "把錢給那好人，讓他走吧。"</p>
    <p>
      "It's from Mr. Rossi, isn't it? Yes? I thought it was. You've only to say
      three Ave Marias when you wake in the morning and you get anything you
      want. I knew the Signora was dying for a letter, so...."
    </p>
    <p>
      "這是來自羅西先生的，對吧？是的？我就知道是。你只需要在早上醒來時說三聲聖母瑪利亞經，你就能得到你想要的任何東西。我知道這位夫人正在渴望一封信，所以...."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, yes, but the poor man is waiting, and I must get on with my work,
      and...."
    </p>
    <p>"是的，是的，但那位可憐的人在等待，我必須繼續我的工作，還有...."</p>
    <p>
      "Work? Ah, Signora, in paradise you won't have to waste your time working.
      A lady like you will have violins and celestial bread and...."
    </p>
    <p>
      "工作？啊，夫人，在天堂裡，您將不必浪費時間做這種事情。像您這樣的淑女將擁有小提琴和天上的麵包..."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The man will be gone, godmother," said Roma, hustling the deaf old woman
      out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "那個男人將會離開，教母，" Roma說，一邊催促著這個耳聾的老女人離開房間。
    </p>
    <p>
      But even when Roma was alone she could not at first find courage to open
      the envelope. There was a certain physical thrill in handling it, in
      turning it over, and in looking at the stamps and the postmark. The stamps
      were French and the postmark was of Paris. That fact brought a vague gleam
      of joy. Rossi had been travelling, and perhaps he had not yet received her
      letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      但是，即使羅馬人獨自一人，她起初也沒有勇氣打開信封。在處理它、翻看它以及檢視郵票和郵戳時，有一種特定的身體震顫。郵票是法國的，郵戳是巴黎的。那個事實帶來了一絲模糊的喜悅。羅西一直在旅行，也許他還沒有收到她的信。

      broke the seal at last, and as the letter came rustling out of the
      envelope she glanced at the closing lines:

      她帶著顫抖的親吻和些許哽咽的祈禱，終於破開了封印。當信件從信封中滑落出來時，她瞥了一眼結尾的幾行：
    </p>
    <p>"Your Faithful Husband."</p>
    <p>"你的忠誠丈夫。"</p>
    <p>
      She caught her breath and waited a moment, tingling all over. Then she
      unfolded the paper and read:—

    <p>
      她屏住呼吸，等待片刻，全身充滿了興奮之感。然後，她展開了紙張，開始閱讀：—

    <p style="padding-top: 0.5em">
      "<span class="smcap">Dearest</span>,—A telegram from Rome, published in
      the Paris newspapers this morning, reports the trial and death of Bruno.
      To say that I am shocked is to say little. I am shaken to my foundations.
      My heart is bursting and my hand can with difficulty hold the pen.
    </p>
    <p style="padding-top: 0.5em">
      "親愛的，今早巴黎的報紙刊登了關於布魯諾在羅馬的審判和死亡的電報。說我震驚實在是言之不足。我從內心深處被震撼。我的心即將崩裂，手中的筆都無法正常握住。"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The news first reached me last evening, when I was in a restaurant with a
      group of journalists. We were at dinner, but I was compelled to rise and
      return to my lodgings. I must have been almost in delirium the whole night
      long. More than once I started from my sleep with the certainty that I
      heard Bruno's voice calling to me. Once I went to the window and looked
      out into the silent street. And yet I knew all the time that my poor
      friend lay dead in prison.
    </p>
    <p>
      "昨晚我在餐廳與一群記者吃晚餐時，首次獲得了這個消息，但我被迫起身並返回我的住所。昨晚我一定處於近乎發狂的狀態。我多次從睡夢中驚醒，確信我聽到布魯諾的聲音在叫我。有一次我走到窗邊，向寂靜的街道外望去。然而，我始終知道，我那可憐的朋友已經在監獄中去世了。"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor Bruno! I do not hold with suicide under any circumstances. A man's
      life does not belong to himself. Each of us is a soldier, and no sentinel
      ought to kill himself at his post. Who knows what the next turn of the
      battle will be? It is our duty to the General to see the fight out. But
      when the sentinel dies rather than pass a false watchword, suicide is
      sacrifice, death is victory, and God takes His martyr under the wings of
      His mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "可憐的布魯諾!
      在任何情況下，我都不贊成自殺。人的生命並不屬於自己。我們每個人都是士兵，沒有哨兵應該在他的崗位上自殺。誰知道戰爭的下一轉會是什麼?我們有責任對將軍看完這場戰鬥。但是，當哨兵寧願死去，也不願意讓一個錯誤的口令通過，那麼自殺就是犧牲，死亡就是勝利，而上帝會把他的殉道者帶到他的慈悲之翅下。"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The poor fellow died believing I had been false to him! I knew him for
      eight years, and during that time he was more faithful to me than my
      shadow. He was the bravest, staunchest friend man ever had. And now he has
      left me, thinking I have wronged him at the last. Oh, my brother, do you
      not know the truth at last? In the world to which you are gone, does no
      heavenly voice tell you? Does not death reveal everything? Can you not
      look down and see all, tearing away the veil that clouded your vision here
      below? Is it only vouchsafed to him who remains on earth to know that he
      was true to the love you bore him? God forbid it! It cannot, cannot be.
    </p>
    <p>
      "那可憐的人死了，認為我對他不忠！我認識他八年，這期間他對我比我自己的影子還忠誠。他是人間最勇敢、最堅定的朋友。現在他離開了我，認為我在最後辜負了他。哦，我的兄弟，你是否最後知道了真相？在你去的那個世界裡，是否有天使向你揭示真相？死亡不是揭示了一切嗎？你不能從上面看下來，雲霾遮蔽的畫面不再，您能看清所有嗎？只有留在地球上的人才知道他對你的愛是真誠的嗎？上帝不會允許這樣！絕對不會的。"

      despaired of any union of interests so pitifully subdivided when the news
      of Bruno's death came like a trumpet-blast, and the walls of the social
      Jericho fell before it. Everybody feels that the moment of action has
      arrived, and what I thought would be an Italian movement is likely to

      of these tyrannies. Of course the ruling classes at home will wash their

      this crime has touched the conscience of the people. He didn't do it? No,

      男爵站起來，在壁爐地毯上走來走去。
      "真是個美好的世紀，對於那些被視為智者的愚人，和對於足夠遠就會威脅的弱者來說！...貴族，你有跟其他人談過這件事情嗎?"
    </p>
    <p>"To nobody whatever, Excellency."</p>
    <p>"對任何人都不是，閣下。"</p>
    <p>
      "Then think no more about it. It's nothing. The public mind must not be
      alarmed. Tighten the cord about our man in Paris. Adieu!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "那就不要再想了。這沒有什麼。公眾的心不必被驚動。緊盯著我們在巴黎的那個人。再見!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Baron's next visitor was the Prefect of the Province, who looked more
      solemn and soldierly than ever.<span

    </p>
    <p>男爵的下一位訪客是省長，他比以往看起來更加嚴肅和戰士般。</p>
    <p>
      "Senator," said the Baron, "I sent for you to say that the Council has
      determined to put an end to the state of siege."
    </p>
    <p>
      "參議員，"男爵說，"我召喚你來是想告訴你，議會已決定結束這個處於圍城狀態的情況。"
    </p>
    <p>The Prefect bowed again severely.</p>
    <p>「總督再次嚴肅地鞠躬。」</p>
    <p>
      "The insurrection has been suppressed, the city is quiet, and the
      severities of military rule begin to oppress the people."
    </p>
    <p>"起義已經被鎮壓，城市回復了平靜，但軍事統治的嚴格開始壓迫人民。"</p>
    <p>The Prefect bowed again and assented.</p>
    <p>"縣長再次鞠躬並表示同意。"</p>
    <p>
      "The Council has also resolved, dear Senator, that the country shall
      celebrate the anniversary of the King's accession with general
      rejoicings."
    </p>
    <p>
      "親愛的參議員，議會也已決定，我們的國家將以全民共慶的方式慶祝國王繼位的週年紀念。"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Excellent idea, sir," said the Prefect. "To wipe out the depression of
      the late unhappy times by a public festival is excellent policy. But the
      time is short."
    </p>
    <p>
      "非常好的想法，先生，"警察局長說。"透過公共節日來消除最近不幸時期的壓抑情緒是非常好的政策。但是時間非常短。"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very short. The anniversary falls on Easter Monday. That is to say, a
      week from to-day. You will therefore take the matter in hand immediately
      and push it on without further delay. The details we will discuss later,
      and arrange all programmes of presentations and processions. Meantime I
      have written a proclamation announcing the event. Here it is. You can take
      it with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "非常簡短。紀念日正好是復活節星期一。也就是說，就在今天一週之後。因此，你將馬上開始處理這件事，並毫不拖延地推進。我們將在稍後討論詳情並安排所有禮品的程序和遊行。同時我已經寫了一篇宣告以公告這件事。這就是它。你可以帶著它走。"
    </p>
    <p>"Good!"</p>
    <p>"好!"</p>
    <p>
      "The King will also sign a decree of amnesty to all the authors and
      accomplices of the late acts and attempts at rebellion who were not the
      organising and directing minds. That is also written. Here it is. But his
      Majesty has not yet signed it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "國王也將簽署一項赦免所有最近反叛行為的作者和同謀者的特赦令，只要他們不是組織和指導者。這也寫在這裡。但是陛下還尚未簽署。"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prefect took a second paper from the Baron's hand, glanced his eyes
      over it, and read certain passages. "'Seeing that on a day of public
      rejoicing we could not restrain an emotion of grief ... turning a pitying
      eye upon the inexperienced youths drawn into a vortex of political
      disorder ... we therefore decree and command the following acts of
      sovereign clemency....' May I expect to receive this in the course of the
      day, your Excellency?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "總督從男爵手中接過第二個檔案,掃過眼前後,閱讀了其中的一些段落。'看到在公眾歡慶的日子裡,我們不能抑制悲痛的情感...用憐憫的眼光看著那些無經驗的青年被捲入政治混亂的漩渦...因此我們頒布並命令以下的主權寬恕的行為...'
      我可以期待在今天之內收到這個，陛下嗎？"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. And now for your own part of the enterprise, dear Senator. You will
      order all mayors of towns to assemble in Rome to complete the
      preparations. You will arrange a procession to the Quirinal, when the
      people will call the King on to the balcony and sing the National Hymn.
      You will order banners to be made bearing suitable watchwords, such as
      'Long live the King,' 'May he govern as well as reign,' 'Long live the
      Crown,' the 'Flag,' and (perhaps) the 'Army.' You will oppose these
      generating ideas to 'Atheism' and<span

      ></span>
      'Anarchy.' The essential point is that the people must be caused by
      festivals, songs, bands of music, and processions to think of the throne
      as their bulwark and the King as their saviour, and to take advantage of
      every opportunity to attest their gratitude to both. You follow me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "是的。現在輪到您自己的部分了，親愛的參議員。您將命令所有城長集結在羅馬，完成準備工作。您將安排一場到奎利諾台的遊行，當人們呼喚國王走到陽臺上，並演唱國歌。您將命令製作帶有適當口號的橫幅，如'國王萬歲'，'願他既要執政也要統治'，'皇冠萬歲'，'旗幟'，和（也許）'軍隊'。您將這些生成的想法與'無神論'和'無政府狀態'相對。重要的是，人們必須透過節日，歌曲，樂隊和遊行來將王座視為他們的屏障，並將國王視為他們的救世主，並趁每一個機會來表達他們對這兩者的感激之情。你跟得上我嗎？"
    </p>
    <p>"Perfectly."</p>
    <p>"完美無瑕。"</p>
    <p>"Then lose no time, Senator.... One moment."</p>
    <p>那就別浪費時間了，參議員....等一下。</p>
    <p>The Prefect had risen and reached the door.</p>
    <p>警察局長已經站起來並走到了門口。</p>
    <p>
      "If you can double the King's guard and change the company every day until
      the festival is over...."
    </p>
    <p>"如果你能加倍國王的衛兵，並每天更換陣容，直到節日結束...."</p>
    <p>
      "Easily, your Excellency. But wait; the Vatican Chief of Police has asked
      for help on Holy Thursday."
    </p>
    <p>"輕松一點，閣下。但等一下; 教廷警察局長已經在聖週四尋求了幫助。"</p>
    <p>
      "Give it him. Let the timid old man of the Sacred College have no excuse
      for saying we take more care of the King than of the Pope."
    </p>
    <p>"把它給他。讓神聖學院的膽小的老人沒有藉口說我們比對教皇更關心國王。"</p>
    <p>
      The Minister of Justice was the next of the Baron's visitors. He was a
      short man with a smiling and rubicund face, and he wore yellow kid gloves.
    </p>
    <p>
      `接下來到訪男爵的是司法部長。這位部長是個矮矮的男子，臉上帶著微笑和紅潤的光芒，他戴著黃色的小羔羊皮手套。`
    </p>
    <p>
      "All goes well and wisdom is justified of her children," said the Baron,
      rising again and promenading the hearthrug. "The national sentiment, dear
      colleague, is a sword, and either we must use it on behalf of the
      Government and the King, or stand by and see it used by the hostile
      factions."
    </p>
    <p>
      "一切都進行得很順利，智慧由她的孩子們證明，"男爵說著再次站起來，在壁爐地毯上散步。"親愛的同事，國家情感就是一把劍，我們必須代表政府和國王使用它，否則就只能站在一旁，看著它被敵對派系使用。"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Men like Rossi are not slow to use it, sir," said the little Minister.
    </p>
    <p>"像羅西這樣的人，先生，不會緩慢地使用它," 小牧師說。</p>
    <p>
      "Tut! It's not Rossi I'm thinking of now. It's the Church, the clergy,
      rich in money and in the faith of the populace. That's why I wanted to do
      something as set-off against those mourning demonstrations which the Pope
      has appointed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "嘖！我現在想的不是羅西。我在想的是教會，牧師，他們擁有財富和人民的信仰。這就是我想要對抗那些由教宗指定的悼念活動而做些事情的原因。"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, the old gentleman of the Vatican knows the instincts and cravings of
      our people, doesn't he, sir? He knows they like a show, and the seasoning
      of their pleasures with a little religion."
    </p>
    <p>
      "是的，梵蒂岡的那位老紳士知道我們人民的本能和渴望，不是嗎，先生？他知道他們喜歡看表演，並在他們的樂趣中加入一點宗教調味料。"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's the rustiest old weapon in the Pope's arsenal, dear colleague, but
      it may serve unless we do something. If the people can be persuaded that
      the Pope is their one friend in adversity, there couldn't be a better
      feather in the Papal cap. Happily our people love to sing and to dance as
      well as to weep and to pray. So we needn't throw up the sponge yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "這是教皇武器庫裡最老舊的武器，親愛的同事，但除非我們做些什麼，否則它也許還能派上用場。如果人們能被說服教皇是他們在逆境中的唯一朋友，那麼沒有比這更適合作為教皇帽的羽毛了。幸好我們的人民喜愛唱歌和跳舞，也喜歡哭泣和禱告。所以我們還不需要放棄。"
    </p>
    <p>
      Both laughed, and the little Minister said, "Besides, it is so easy to
      change religious processions into political ones.<span
        class="x-ebookmaker-pageno"
        id="pgepubid00410"
        title="322"
        ><a id="Page_322" title="322"></a
      ></span>
      And then the Vatican is always intriguing with the powers of rebellion and
      preaching obedience to the Pope alone."
    </p>
    <p>
      兩人都笑了，然後小牧師說：“此外，將宗教遊行變成政治遊行是如此的容易。而且，梵蒂岡總是與反叛勢力密謀，並唯一呼籲人們服從教皇。”
    </p>
    <p>
      The creaking of the Baron's patent-leather boots stopped, and he drew up
      before his colleague.
    </p>
    <p>男爵的專利皮靴的吱吱聲停了下來，他停在他的同事面前。</p>
    <p>
      "Watch that sharply," he said, "and if you see any sign on the part of the
      Vatican of intriguing with men like Rossi, any complicity with conspiracy,
      or any knowledge of plots pointing to revolution and regicide, let the
      Council hear of it immediately."
    </p>
    <p>
      "小心觀察，"他說，"如果你看到梵蒂岡和像羅西這樣的人勾結的任何跡象，與陰謀有任何合謀，或知道任何可能指向革命和弒君的陰謀，立即通知理事會。"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Baron's face had suddenly whitened with passion, and his little
      colleague looked at him in alarm. A secretary entered the room and handed
      the Baron a card. The Baron fixed his eye-glasses and read: "<span
        class="smcap"
        >Monsignor Mario</span
      >, Cameriere Segreto Partecipante di Sua Santità Pio X. Vaticano."
    </p>
    <p>
      伯爵的臉色因為激動而突然變白，他的小夥伴驚恐地看著他。一位秘書走進房間，遞給伯爵一張卡片。伯爵調整了眼鏡，閱讀到：“教宗庇護十世的秘密參與者，Mario
      Monsignor。梵蒂岡。”
    </p>
    <p>"St. Anthony! Talk of the angels...." muttered the little Minister.</p>
    <p>“聖安東尼！談論天使...." 小教士嘀咕道。</p>
    <p>"Will you perhaps...."</p>
    <p>"你是否可能...."</p>
    <p>"Certainly," said the Minister, and he left the room.</p>
    <p>"當然，"部長說，然後他離開了房間。</p>
    <p>"Show the Monsignor in," said the Baron.</p>
    <p>「請讓主教進來，」男爵說。</p>
    <h3 id="pgepubid00411">VII</h3>
    <p>
      The Monsignor was young, tall, slight, almost fragile, and had thin black
      hair and large spiritual eyes. As he entered in the long black overcoat,
      which covered his cassock, he bowed and looked slowly round the room. His
      subdued expression was that of a sheep going through a gate where the dogs
      may be, and his manner suggested that he would fly at the first alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      這位神父年輕，高大，瘦弱，近乎虛弱，並有著薄薄的黑髮和極大的靈性眼神。他身披長黑風衣覆蓋著他的僧袍進入，當他進入時，他鞠躬並慢慢地繞著房間看。他壓抑的表情就像是一頭穿過可能有狗的門關的羊，他的舉止讓人覺得他會在第一次警報時逃跑。
    </p>
    <p>
      The Baron looked over his eye-glasses and measured his man in a moment.
      "Pray sit," he said, and at the next moment the young Monsignor and the
      Baron were seated at opposite sides of the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      男爵透過他的眼鏡看過去，一瞬間就評估出了對方。
      “請坐，”他說，下一刻年輕的主教和男爵就坐在桌子的對面了。
    </p>
    <p>"I am sent to you by a venerable and illustrious personage...."</p>
    <p>"我是由一位可敬和傑出的人物派來找您的...."</p>
    <p>"Let us say the Pope," said the Baron.</p>
    <p>"讓我們說是教皇,"男爵說。</p>
    <p>
      The young Monsignor bowed and continued, "to offer on his behalf a word of
      counsel and of warning."
    </p>
    <p>那位年輕的樞機神父鞠躬並繼續說，“躬代他人訴之一言，給予忠告和警告。”</p>
    <p>"It is an unusual and distinguished honour," said the Baron.</p>
    <p>“這是一種不同尋常且卓越的榮譽，”男爵說道。</p>
    <p>
      "I am instructed to inform you that the Holy Father has reason to believe
      a further and more serious insurrection is<span
        class="x-ebookmaker-pageno"
        id="pgepubid00412"
        title="323"
        ><a id="Page_323" title="323"></a
      ></span>
      preparing, and to warn you to take the necessary steps to secure public
      order and to prevent bloodshed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "我被指示通知你，教宗有理由相信更嚴重的叛亂正在醞釀之中，並警告你採取必要的措施來維持公共秩序，防止流血衝突。"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Baron did not move a muscle. "If the Holy Father has special knowledge
      of a plot that is impending...."
    </p>
    <p>"男爵一動不動。他說：“如果教皇對即將發生的陰謀有特殊的瞭解…"</p>
    <p>
      "Not special, only general, but sufficient to enable him to tell you to
      hold yourself in readiness."
    </p>
    <p>"不特殊，只是一般，但足以讓他告訴你要隨時準備好。"</p>
    <p>"How long has the Holy Father been aware of this?"</p>
    <p>"教宗知道這件事有多久了？"</p>
    <p>
      "Not long. In fact, only since yesterday morning," said the Monsignor, and
      fearing he had said too much he added, "I only mention this to show you
      that the Holy Father has lost no time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "不久。實際上，只是從昨天早上開始，"樞機主教說，他擔心自己說得太多，所以他又說，"我只是提這個讓你知道，教宗沒有浪費任何時間。"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But if the Holy Father knows that a conspiracy is afoot, he can no doubt
      help us to further information."
    </p>
    <p>"但如果教宗知道有陰謀正在進行，他無疑可以幫助我們獲得更多的資訊。"</p>
    <p>The Monsignor shook his head.</p>
    <p>樞機主教搖了搖頭。</p>
    <p>"You mean that he will not do so?"</p>
    <p>"你的意思是他不會這麼做嗎？"</p>
    <p>"No."</p>
    <p>"不"</p>
    <p>
      "Am I, then, to understand that the information with which his Holiness
      honours me came to him secretly?"
    </p>
    <p>"那我是否可以理解為，他的聖潔向我提供的資訊是秘密地傳給他的？"</p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir, secretly, and it is, therefore, not open to further
      explanation."
    </p>
    <p>"是的，先生，這是秘密的，因此，不再需要進一步的解釋。"</p>
    <p>"So it reached him by the medium of the confessional?"</p>
    <p>"所以它是透過告解的方式傳達給他的嗎？"</p>
    <p>
      The Monsignor rose from his seat. "Your Excellency cannot be in earnest."
    </p>
    <p>"主教從座位上起身。他說：“尊敬的主教，你不可能是認真的。”"</p>
    <p>
      "You mean that it did not reach him by the medium of the confessional?"
    </p>
    <p>"你的意思是，這件事並非透過告解的方式傳達給他的嗎？"</p>
    <p>"Certainly not."</p>
    <p>"當然不是。"</p>
    <p>"Then he is able to tell me everything, if he will?"</p>
    <p>"那麼如果他願意，他能告訴我所有的事情嗎？"</p>
    <p>
      The Monsignor became agitated. "The Holy Father's information came through
      a channel that is assimilated to the confessional, and is almost as sacred
      and inviolate."
    </p>
    <p>
      "主教顯得焦慮。他說：'教皇的資訊來源被視為懺悔之道，幾乎同樣神聖，不可侵犯。'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But obedience to the Pope obliterates from all other responsibility. His
      Holiness has only to say 'Speak,' and his faithful child must obey."
    </p>
    <p>
      "但對教皇的服從會消除所有其他的責任。只要他的聖潔說'說'，他的忠實孩子就必須服從。"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Monsignor became confused. "His informant is not even a Catholic, and
      he has, therefore, no right to command her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "主教變得困惑。「他的線人甚至不是天主教徒，因此，他沒有權力指揮她。」"
    </p>
    <p>
      "So it is a woman," said the Baron, and the young ecclesiastic dropped his
      head.
    </p>
    <p>"所以這是一個女人，"男爵說，年輕的神職人員低下了頭。</p>
    <p>
      "It is a woman and a non-Catholic, and she visited the Holy Father at the
      Vatican yesterday morning; is that so?"
    </p>
    <p>"這是一位非天主教的女士，她昨天上午拜訪了教宗在梵蒂岡的聖座，對嗎？"</p>
    <p>"I do not assert it, sir, and I do not deny it."</p>
    <p>"我並不是在斷定，先生，也不是在否認。"</p>
    <p>
      The Baron did not speak for a moment, but he looked<span
        class="x-ebookmaker-pageno"
        id="pgepubid00413"
        title="324"
        ><a id="Page_324" title="324"></a
      ></span>
      steadily over his eye-glasses at the flushed young face before him. Then
      he said in a quiet tone:
    </p>
    <p>
      "男爵有一會兒沒說話，但他一直透過他的眼鏡定定地看著他面前那張激動的年輕面孔。然後他用平靜的語氣說:"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monsignor, the relations of the Pope and the Government are delicate, and
      if anything occurred to carry the disagreement further it might result in
      a serious fratricidal struggle."
    </p>
    <p>
      "教宗大人，教宗和政府的關係是微妙的，如果發生任何事情使爭議進一步加劇，可能將導致嚴重的兄弟相爭。"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Monsignor was trying to regain his self-possession, and he remained
      silent.
    </p>
    <p>"主教正在試圖恢復他的鎮定，他保持沉默。"</p>
    <p>
      "But whatever those relations, it cannot be the wish of the Holy Father to
      cover with his mantle the upsetters of order who are cutting at the roots
      of the Church as well as the State."
    </p>
    <p>
      "但不論那些關係如何，教皇的願望絕不可能是用他的斗篷保護那些破壞秩序、既砍斷教會根因又顛覆國家的人。"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Therefore I am here now, sir, thus early and thus openly," said the
      Monsignor.
    </p>
    <p>"因此，我現在就在這裡了，先生，這麼早就這麼開放地在這裡了，"主教說。</p>
    <p>
      "Monsignor," said the Baron, "if anything should occur to—for example—the
      person of the King, it cannot be the wish of his Holiness that
      anybody—myself, for instance—should be in a position to say to Parliament
      and to the Governments of Europe, 'The Pope knew everything beforehand,
      and therefore, not having revealed the particulars of the plot, the
      venerable Father of the Vatican is an accomplice of murderers.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "男爵對樞機主教說，'如果有任何事情發生在——例如——國王的身上，我認為教宗的意願絕不能是讓任何人——例如我——在議會和歐洲政府面前說出，'教宗事先已知道所有的事情，但因為沒有透露陰謀的所有細節，故此梵蒂岡的尊敬之父其實是兇手的同謀。'"
    </p>
    <p>
      The young ecclesiastic lost himself utterly. "The Pope," he said, "knows
      nothing more than I have told you."
    </p>
    <p>那位年輕的教士完全迷失了自己。他說：“教皇所知無過於我告訴你的。”</p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Monsignor, the Pope knows one thing more. He knows who was his
      informant and authority. It is necessary that the Government should know
      that also, in order that it may judge for itself of the nature of the
      conspiracy and the source from which it may be expected."
    </p>
    <p>
      "是的，主教，教皇有知道一件事情。他知道誰是他的消息提供者和權威。政府也需要知道這件事，以便他們可以自己判定這個陰謀的性質以及可能期待的來源。"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Monsignor was quivering like a limed bird. "I have delivered my
      message, and have only to add that in sending me here his Holiness desired
      to prevent crime, not to help you to apprehend criminals."

    <p>
      樞機主教像被獵人黏住的鳥一樣顫抖。他說，“我已經傳達了我的訊息，我只需補充，教皇讓我來這裡是為了防止犯罪，而不是幫助你們抓住罪犯。”
    </p>
    <p>
      The Baron's eye-glasses dropped from his nose, and he spoke sharply and
      incisively. "The Government must at least know who the lady was who
      visited his Holiness at the Vatican yesterday morning, and led him to
      believe that a serious insurrection was impending."
    </p>
    <p>
      男爵的眼鏡從鼻子上滑落，他的語調尖銳決絕。
      "政府至少應該知道昨天早上在梵蒂岡拜訪過他聖下的那位女士是誰，並使他相信一場嚴重的暴動即將發生。"
    </p>
    <p>"That your Excellency never will, or can, or shall know."</p>
    <p>"閣下永遠不會，也無法，或者不應該知道。"</p>
    <p>
      The Monsignor was bowing himself out of the room when the Baron's
      secretary opened the door and announced another visitor.
    </p>
    <p>當樞機主教正在鞠躬走出房間時，男爵的秘書打開門，宣佈又有另一位訪客。</p>
    <p>
      "Donna Roma, your Excellency."<span

    </p>
    <p>"羅馬女士，閣下尊銜。"</p>
    <p>The Monsignor betrayed fresh agitation, and tried to go.</p>
    <p>"主教顯露出新的不安，並試圖離開。"</p>
    <p>"Bring her in," said the Baron. "One moment, Monsignor."</p>
    <p>"把她帶進來,"男爵說。"請等一下，主教。"</p>
    <p>
      "I have said all I am authorised to say, sir, and I feel warned that I
      must say no more."
    </p>
    <p>"我已經說了我被授權說的所有內容，先生，我感到警告，我不能再說。”</p>
    <p>"Don't say that, Monsignor.... Ah, Donna Roma!"</p>
    <p>"不要這麼說，主教.... 啊，羅馬女士!"</p>
    <p>Roma, who had entered the room, replied with reserve and dignity.</p>
    <p>羅馬走進了房間，以充滿保留和尊嚴的態度回答。</p>
    <p>
      "Allow me, Donna Roma, to present Monsignor Mario of the Vatican," said
      the Baron.
    </p>
    <p>"請允許我，羅馬女士，向您介紹梵蒂岡的蒙希尼爾馬利歐，"男爵說。</p>
    <p>
      "It is unnecessary," said Roma. "I met the Monsignor yesterday morning."
    </p>
    <p>"這是不必要的，" 羅馬說。"我昨天早上見到了主教。"</p>
    <p>The young ecclesiastic was overwhelmed with confusion.</p>
    <p>那位年輕的教士深感困惑。</p>
    <p>
      "My respectful reverence to his Holiness," said the Baron, smiling, "and
      pray tell him that the Government will do its duty to the country and to
      the civilised world, and count on the support of the Pope."
    </p>
    <p>
      "我對他的聖潔表示尊敬,"男爵笑著說,
      "並請告訴他，政府將對國家和文明世界履行其職責，並依賴教皇的支持。"
    </p>
    <p>Monsignor Mario left the room without a word.</p>
    <p>"主教瑪利歐沒有說一句話就離開了房間。"</p>
    <h3 id="pgepubid00415">VIII</h3>
    <p>
      The Baron pushed out an easy-chair for Roma and twisted his own to face
      it.
    </p>
    <p>男爵為羅馬推出一張舒適的椅子，並將自己的椅子扭轉以面對它。</p>
    <p>"How are you, my child?"</p>
    <p>"你好嗎，我的孩子？"</p>
    <p>"One lives," said Roma, with a sigh.</p>
    <p>"羅馬說，微微嘆息，「一個人還在活著。」"</p>
    <p>"What is the matter, my dear? You are ill and unhappy."</p>
    <p>"你怎麼了，我的親愛的？你身體不舒服，心情也不好。"</p>
    <p>
      She eluded the question and said, "You sent for me—what do you wish to
      say?"
    </p>
    <p>她避開了那個問題，並說："你叫我來了——你想說什麼？"</p>
    <p>
      He told her the printer of certain seditious proclamations had been
      arrested, and in the judicial inquiry preparatory to his trial he had
      mentioned the name of the person who had employed and paid him.
    </p>
    <p>
      他告訴她，一些具有煽動性的宣言的列印者已被捕，並在準備他的審判的司法調查中，他提到了僱用並支付他的人的名字。
    </p>
    <p>
      "You cannot but be aware, my dear, that you have rendered yourself liable
      to prosecution, and that nothing—nothing whatever—could have saved you
      from public exposure but the good offices of a powerful friend."
    </p>
    <p>
      "你必須明白，我親愛的，你已經使自己有可能被起訴，沒有什麼，絕對沒有什麼可以讓你免於公開曝光，只有一位強大的朋友的好意可以拯救你。"
    </p>
    <p>Roma drew her lips tightly together and made no answer.</p>
    <p>"羅馬緊緊地閉上嘴唇，沒有回答。"</p>
    <p>
      "But what a situation for a Minister! To find himself ruled by his
      feelings for a friend, and thus weakened in the<span

      ></span>
      eyes of his servants, who ought to have no possible hold on him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "但對於一位部長來說，這樣的處境該如何呢！發現自己的情感被朋友左右，由此在他的僕人眼中顯得如此脆弱，他們原本不該對他有任何的掌握能力。"
    </p>
    <p>Roma's gloomy face began to be compressed with scorn.</p>
    <p>"羅馬的陰沉臉色開始被蔑視所壓迫。"</p>
    <p>
      "You have perhaps not realised the full measure of the indignity that
      might have befallen you. For instance—a cruel necessity—the police would
      have been making a domiciliary visitation in your apartment at this
      moment."
    </p>
    <p>
      "也許你還未完全意識到你可能面臨的全面侮辱。例如，一種殘酷的必要－警察此時可能正在你的公寓裡進行家庭訪問。"
    </p>
    <p>Roma made a faint, involuntary cry, and half rose from her seat.</p>
    <p>"羅馬微弱而不自主地叫了一聲，然後半起身從她的座位上。"</p>
    <p>
      "Your letters and most secret papers would by this time be exposed to the
      eyes of the police.... No, no, my child; calm yourself, be seated; thanks
      to my intervention, this will not occur."
    </p>
    <p>
      "你的信件和最秘密的檔案現在可能已經暴露在警方的視線下...
      不，不，我的孩子，冷靜下來，坐下來；感謝我的干預，這樣的事情不會發生。"
    </p>
    <p>
      Roma looked at him, and found him more repulsive to her at that moment
      than he had ever been before. Even his daintiness repelled her—the
      modified perfume about his clothes, his waxed moustache, his rounded
      finger-nails, and all the other refinements of the man who loves himself
      and sets out to please the senses of women.
    </p>
    <p>
      "羅馬看著他，發現此刻他比以往任何時候都更令她反感。甚至他的講究都讓她厭惡——他衣物上的淡淡香水，打蠟的鬍子，圓滑的指甲，以及他身上所有其他為了愛自己和迎合女性感官而做出的細節都令她反感。"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will allow, my dear, that I have had sufficient to humiliate me
      without this further experience. A ward who persistently disregards the
      laws of propriety and exposes herself to criticism in the most ordinary
      acts of life was surely a sufficient trial. But that was not enough.
      Almost as soon as you have passed out of my legal control you join with
      those who are talking and conspiring against me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "你要理解，親愛的，我已經被羞辱得足夠多了，不需要再經歷這種事。一個不斷無視禮節法則，並且在生活中的最普通行為中讓自己暴露在批評之下的孩子，無疑已經是我足夠的煎熬。但那還不夠。就在你剛剛擺脫我法律上的控制不久，你就加入了那些對我說三道四，甚至密謀對抗我的人之中。"
    </p>
    <p>Roma continued to sit with a gloomy and defiant face.</p>
    <p>"羅馬繼續帶著陰沉且挑釁的臉孔坐著。"</p>
    <p>
      "How am I to defend myself against the humiliations you put upon me in
      your own mind? You give me no chance to defend myself. I cannot know what
      others have told you. I know no more than you repeat to me, and that is
      nothing at all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "我該如何對抗你在心中對我造成的羞辱？你並未給我任何機會去為自己辯護。我不知道別人對你說了什麼。你告訴我的所有事情我都已知道，那根本不算什麼。"
    </p>
    <p>Roma was biting her compressed lips and breathing audibly.</p>
    <p>羅馬咬著她的緊閉的嘴唇，聲音明顯地呼吸。</p>
    <p>
      "How am I to defend myself against the humiliations I suffer in the minds
      of the public? There is only one way, and that is to allow it to be
      believed that, in spite of all appearances, you are still playing a part,
      that you are going to all lengths to punish the enemy who traduced you and
      publicly degraded you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "我要如何才能對抗在公眾心目中遭受的羞辱？只有一種方式，那就是讓人們相信，儘管所有的表象都已經顯露，你仍然在扮演一個角色，你正在盡一切努力懲罰那個貶低你，並在公開場合羞辱你的敵人。"
    </p>
    <p>
      Roma tried to laugh, but the laugh was broken in her throat by a rising
      sob.
    </p>
    <p>"羅馬試圖笑出來，但是她的喉嚨裡升起的一聲哽咽打斷了她的笑聲。"</p>
    <p>
      "I have only to whisper that, dear friend, and society, at<span

      all events, will credit it. Already it knows the very minute details of
      your life, and it will believe that when you threw away every shred of
      propriety and went to live in that man's apartment, it was only in order
      to play the old part—shall I say the Scriptural part?—of possessing
      yourself of <i>the inmost secrets of his soul</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      "我只需要低聲細語這件事，親愛的朋友，至少社會會相信的。它已經知道你生活的每一個微細細節，當你拋棄所有的規矩，去住在那個男人的公寓時，它會相信你只是為了扮演舊角色——我可以說是聖經中的角色嗎？——為了掌握他心靈最深處的秘密。"
    </p>
    <p>
      The clear, sharp whisper in which the Baron spoke his last words cut Roma
      like a knife. She threw up her head with scorn.
    </p>
    <p>男爵清晰、尖銳的耳語，像刀一樣刺痛了羅馬，她滿懷蔑視地抬起頭來。</p>
    <p>
      "Let it believe what it likes," she said. "If society cares to think that
      I have allowed my life to be turned upside down for the sake of hatred,
      let it do so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "讓它自由地去相信它所喜歡的，"她說。"如果社會在意並認為我願意因為仇恨而讓我的生活變得顛倒，那就讓它這麼想吧。"
    </p>
    <p>The Baron's secretary interrupted by opening the door.</p>
    <p>男爵的秘書開門，打斷了他們。</p>
    <p>"Nazzareno, Excellency," said the secretary.</p>
    <p>“閣下，那札雷諾，”秘書說。</p>
    <p>
      "Ah! Let him come in," said the Baron. "You remember Nazzareno, Roma? My
      steward at Albano?"
    </p>
    <p>
      「啊！讓他進來，"男爵說。"你記得納扎雷諾，羅馬嗎？我在阿爾巴諾的管家？”
    </p>
    <p>
      An elderly man with a bronzed face and shaggy eyebrows, bringing an odour
      of the fields and the farmyard, was ushered into the room.
    </p>
    <p>一位臉色黝黑、濃眉大眼的老人，帶著田野和農場的氣息，被帶進了房間。</p>
    <p>
      "Come in, Nazzareno! You've not forgotten Donna Roma? You planted a
      rosebush on her first Roman birthday, you remember. It's a great tree by
      this time, perhaps."
    </p>
    <p>
      "請進來，拿撒勒諾！你還記得 Donna Roma
      嗎？你在她的第一個羅馬生日種下了一株玫瑰，你還記得吧。現在那應該已經是一棵大樹了。"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is, Excellency," said the steward, bowing and smiling, "and nearly as
      full of bloom as the Signorina herself."
    </p>
    <p>"是的，閣下，"管家鞠躬並笑著說，"幾乎像小姐自己一樣充滿了花朵。"</p>
    <p>"Well, what news from Albano?"</p>
    <p>"那麼，來自阿爾巴諾的消息是什麼呢？"</p>
    <p>
      The steward told a long story of operations on the estates—planting birch
      in the top fields, and eucalyptus in the low meadow, fencing, draining,
      and sowing.
    </p>
    <p>
      `管家娓娓道來的故事，關於莊園裡的各種運作——將樺樹種在高田，將桉樹種在低地的草場，築牆築石，排水，播種。`
    </p>
    <p>"And ... and the Baroness?" said the Baron, turning over some papers.</p>
    <p>"那麼...男爵夫人呢？"男爵說，邊翻閱著一些文件。</p>
    <p>
      "Ah! her Excellency is worse," said the old man. "The nurse and the doctor
      thought you had better be told exactly, and that is the object of my
      errand."
    </p>
    <p>
      "啊！她的尊貴病情愈來愈糟,"
      老人說。"護士和醫生認為你應該被完全告知，這就是我使命的目的。"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes?" The papers rustled in the Baron's fingers as he shuffled and sorted
      them.
    </p>
    <p>"是的?"男爵的手指在整理和分揀文件時，紙張發出沙沙的聲音。</p>
    <p>
      The steward told another long story. Her Excellency was weaker, or she
      would be quite ungovernable. And so changed! When he was called in
      yesterday she was so much altered that he would not have known her. It was
      a question of days, and all the servants were saying prayers to Mary
      Magdalene.
    </p>
    <p>
      管家又講了一個長篇大論的故事。她的殿下已經虛弱不堪，否則她會完全無法控制。她變化如此之大！就在昨天，他被召喚時，她的變化如此之大，以至於他無法認出她。這是在計算日子，所有的僕人都在向瑪利亞·抹大拉祈禱。
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have some dinner downstairs before you return, Nazzareno," said the
      Baron. "And when you see the doctor this<span
        class="x-ebookmaker-pageno"
        id="pgepubid00418"
        title="328"
        ><a id="Page_328" title="328"></a
      ></span>
      evening, say I'll come out some time this week if I can. Good-morning!"
    </p>
    <p>
      “在你回來之前，去樓下吃頓晚飯，納扎雷諾，”男爵說。“今晚見到醫生的時候，告訴他如果我可以的話，我會在本週的某個時候出去。早上好！”
    </p>
    <p>
      The repulsion the Baron had inspired in Roma deepened to loathing when he
      began to speak affectionately the moment the door had closed on the
      steward.
    </p>
    <p>
      當管家門關上的一刻，男爵開始深情地說話，這使得羅馬對他的厭惡感加深為憎恨。
    </p>
    <p>"Look at this, dearest. It's from his Majesty."</p>
    <p>"看看這個，我最親愛的。這是來自他的陛下的。"</p>
    <p>
      She did not look at the letter he put before her, so he told her what it
      contained. It offered him the Collar of the Annunziata, the highest order
      in Italy, making him a cousin to the King.
    </p>
    <p>
      她並未看他放在她面前的信，因此他告訴她信中的內容。信提到他被授予了安諾齊亞塔項鏈，這是義大利最高的勛章，使他與國王成為親戚。
    </p>
    <p>
      She could not contain herself any longer. "I want to tell you something,"
      she said, "so that you may know once for all that it is useless to waste
      further thought on me."
    </p>
    <p>
      她再也無法控制自己。她說：“我想告訴你一件事，讓你一次就明白對我再有任何的思索都是沒用的。”
    </p>
    <p>He looked at her with an indulgent smile.</p>
    <p>他以寵溺的笑容看著她。</p>
    <p>"I am married to Mr. Rossi," she said.</p>
    <p>"我已嫁給羅西先生," 她說.</p>
    <p>"But that is impossible. There was no time."</p>
    <p>"但那是不可能的。沒有時間。"</p>
    <p>
      "We were married religiously, in the parish church, on the morning he left
      Rome."
    </p>
    <p>"我們在他離開羅馬的那天早上，在教區教堂進行了宗教婚禮。"</p>
    <p>The indulgent smile gave way to a sarcastic one.</p>
    <p>那個寬容的笑容變成了諷刺的一個。</p>
    <p>
      "Then why did he leave you behind? If he thought <i>that</i> was a good
      marriage, why didn't he take you with him? But perhaps he had his own
      reason, and the denunciation of the poor man in prison was not so far
      amiss."
    </p>
    <p>
      "那麼他為何留下你不帶走呢？如果他認為那是一門好婚事，他為何不帶你一起走？但也許他有他自己的理由，而對那個在獄中的窮人的譴責並非那麼錯誤。"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That was an official lie, a cowardly lie," said Roma, and her eyes burned
      with anger.
    </p>
    <p>"那是官方的謊言，是懦弱的謊言，"羅馬說，她的眼睛充滿了憤怒。</p>
    <p>
      "Was it? Perhaps it was. But I have just heard something else about Mr.
      Rossi that is undoubtedly true. I have heard from the Prefect of Paris
      that he is organising a conspiracy for the assassination of the King."
    </p>
    <p>
      "是嗎？也許是的。但我剛聽到其他關於羅西先生的事情，這無疑是真的。我從巴黎的警察局長那裡聽說他正在策劃一次刺殺國王的陰謀。"
    </p>
    <p>A look of fear which she could not restrain crossed Roma's face.</p>
    <p>一種她無法抑制的恐懼神色掠過羅瑪的臉。</p>
    <p>
      "More than that, and stranger than that, I have just heard also that the
      Pope has some knowledge of the plot."
    </p>
    <p>"除此之外，更奇怪的是，我剛剛也聽說教皇對這個陰謀有所瞭解。"</p>
    <p>
      Roma felt terror seizing her, and she said in a constrained voice, "Why?
      What has the Pope told you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "羅馬感到恐慌抓住了她，她用壓抑的聲音說，"為什麼？ 教皇告訴了你什麼？""
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only that an insurrection is impending. It seems that his informant is a
      woman.... Who can she be, I wonder?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "只是一場暴動即將發生。他的消息來源似乎是一名女子...我在想，她會是誰呢?"
    </p>
    <p>The Baron was fixing his eyes on her and she tried to elude his gaze.</p>
    <p>男爵正在注視著她，而她試圖避開他的凝視。</p>
    <p>
      "Whoever she is she must know more," he said in a severe voice, "and
      whatever it is she must reveal it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "無論她是誰，她必須知道的更多，"他嚴厲地說，"不論是什麼，她必須揭示出來。"
    </p>
    <p>
      Roma got up, looking very pale, and feeling very feeble.<span
        class="x-ebookmaker-pageno"

      ></span>
      When she reached the door the Baron was smiling and holding out his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      羅馬站了起來，臉色十分蒼白，感覺非常虛弱。當她走到門口時，男爵微笑著伸出手。
    </p>
    <p>"Will you not shake hands with me?" he said.</p>
    <p>"你不會和我握手嗎？"他說。</p>
    <p>
      "What is the use?" she answered. "When people shake hands it means that
      they wish each other well. You do not wish me well. You are trying to
      force me to betray my husband.... <i>But I'll die first</i>," she said,
      and then turned and fled.
    </p>
    <p>
      “有什麼用？”她回答說。“當人們握手時，這意味著他們希望對方好。但你並不希望我好。你正在試圖迫使我背叛我的丈夫....但我會先死，”她說，然後轉身逃走。
    </p>
    <p>When Roma was gone the Baron wrote a letter to the Pope:</p>
    <p>當羅馬離開後，男爵寫了一封信給教皇：</p>
    <p style="padding-top: 0.5em">
      "<span class="smcap">Your Holiness</span>,—Providential accident, as your
      chamberlain would tell you, has enabled his Majesty's Government to judge
      for itself of that source of your Holiness's information which your
      Holiness very properly refused to reveal. At the same time official
      channels have disclosed to his Majesty's Government the nature of the
      conspiracy of which your Holiness so patriotically forewarned them. This
      conspiracy appears to be no less serious than an attempt to assassinate
      the King, but as detailed knowledge of so vile a plot is necessary in
      order to save the life of our august sovereign, his Majesty's Government
      asks you to grant the Prime Minister the honour of an audience with your
      Holiness in the cause of order and public security. Hoping to hear of your
      Holiness's convenience, and trusting that your Holiness will not
      disappoint the hopes of those who are dreaming even yet of a
      reconciliation of Church and State, I am, with all reverence, your
      Holiness's faithful son and servant,

      Roma went home full of uncertainty, and wrote in a nervous and straggling
      hand a hasty letter to Rossi.
    </p>
    <p>"羅馬滿心不定地回到家中，用顫抖且潦草的字體，急忙給羅西寫了一封信。"</p>
    <p>
      "My dearest," she said, "your letter reached me safely last evening, and
      though I cannot answer it properly at the present moment, I must send a
      brief reply by mid-day's mail, because there are two or three things it is
      imperative I should say immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      "我最親愛的，"她說，"你的信昨晚已安全送達，儘管我現在無法適當地回覆，但我必須在中午郵件中傳送一個簡短的回信，因為有兩三件事我必須立即說明。"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The first is that I wrote you a very important letter to London twelve
      days ago, and it is clear that you have not yet received it. The contents
      were of the greatest seriousness and also of the greatest secrecy, and I
      should die if any<span

      other eye than yours were to read them; therefore do not lose a moment
      until you ask for the letter to be sent after you to Paris. Write to
      London by the first post, and when the letter has come to your hand, do
      telegraph to me saying so. 'Received,' that will be sufficient, but if you
      can add one other little word expressing your feeling on reading what I
      wrote—'Forgiven,' for instance—my feeling will not be happiness, it will
      be delirium.
    </p>
    <p>
      "首先，我在十二天前寫了一封非常重要的信給你在倫敦，顯然你還沒有收到。信的內容極其嚴肅，也極為機密，如果讓除你之外的任何人閱讀，我會十分痛苦；所以你馬上要求信寄去巴黎的每一刻都不能延誤。請你立刻寫信給倫敦，等信到達你手中時，用電報將此事告知我。只要寫上'已收到'就足夠了，但如果你可以在閱讀我所寫的信後加上另一個小小的字來表達你的感受——例如'已原諒'——那我的感覺將不只是快樂，那將是狂喜。"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The next thing I have to say, dearest, is about your letters. You know
      they are more precious to me than my heart's blood, and there is not a
      word or a line of them I would sacrifice for a queen's crown. But they are
      so full of perilous opinions and of hints of programmes for dangerous
      enterprises, that for your sake I am afraid. It is so good of you to tell
      me what you are thinking and doing, and I am so proud to be the woman who
      has the confidence as well as the love of the most-talked-of man in
      Europe, that it cuts at my heart to ask you to tell me no more about your
      political plans. Nevertheless, I must. Think what would happen if the
      police took it into their heads to make a domiciliary visitation in this
      house. And then think of what a fearful weapon it puts into the hands of
      your enemies, if, hearing that I know so much, they put pressure upon me
      that I cannot withstand! Of course, that is impossible. I would die first.
      But still....
    </p>
    <p>
      "下一件我要說的事情，我最親愛的，是關於你的信件。你知道它們對我來說比我心臟的血還要珍貴，沒有一個詞或一行我願意為了王后的冠冕犧牲。但是，它們充滿了危險的觀點和對危險企業的暗示，為了你，我感到害怕。你告訴我你在想什麼和在做什麼，這是你的好，我很自豪能成為一個擁有你的信任和愛情的女人，你是歐洲最受矚目的男人，這讓我心痛，要求你不再告訴我你的政治計劃。然而，我必須這麼做。想想如果警察想在這個房子裡進行家庭訪視會發生什麼。然後想想如果知道我知道這麼多，他們對我施加我無法抵擋的壓力，這會將何等恐怖的武器放在你的敵人手中！當然，那是不可能的。我會先死。但是還是......"

    <p>"My last point, dearest...."</p>
    <p>"我最後的觀點，最親愛的...."</p>
    <p>
      Her pen stopped. How was she to put what she wished to say next? David
      Rossi was in danger—a double danger—danger from within as well as danger
      from without. His last letter showed plainly that he was engaged in an
      enterprise which his adversaries would call a plot. Roma remembered her
      father, doomed to a life-long exile and a lonely death, and asked herself
      if it was not always the case that the reformer partly reformed his age,
      and was partly corrupted by it.
    </p>
    <p>
      她的筆停了下來。她要如何描述接下來她想說的話？大衛·羅西身處雙重危險中 --
      來自內部以及外部的威脅。他的最後一封信清楚地顯示他正在參與一個他的對手會稱之為陰謀的事業。羅馬回想起她的父親，被命運長久流亡，孤獨死亡，她問自己，改革者是否總是部分改革他的時代，而又部分被它腐蝕？
    </p>
    <p>
      If she could only draw David Rossi away from associations that were always
      reeking of revolution, if she could bring him back to Rome before he was
      too far involved in plots and with plotters! But how could she do it? To
      tell him the plain truth that he was going headlong to
      <i>domicilio coatto</i> was useless. She must resort to artifice. A light
      shot through her brain, her eyes gleamed, and she began again:<span
        class="x-ebookmaker-pageno"
        id="pgepubid00422"
        title="331"
        ><a id="Page_331" title="331"></a
      ></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      如果她能夠把大衛·羅西從那些始終充滿革命氣息的關係中拉開，如果她能在他太深陷入陰謀和陰謀者之前把他帶回羅馬！但她怎麼能做到呢？告訴他一個明白的事實，就是他正在慌不擇路的去碰觸強迫症是無用的。她必須求助於欺騙。一道光射進她的大腦，她的眼睛閃耀著，然後她又開始了：
    </p>
    <p>
      "My last point, dearest, is that I am growing jealous. Yes, indeed,
      jealous! I know you love me, but knowing it doesn't help me to forget that
      you are always meeting women who must admire and love you. I tremble to
      think you may be happy with them. I want you to be happy, yet I feel as if
      it would be treason for you to be happy without me. What an illogical
      thing love is! But where Love reigns jealousy is always the Prime
      Minister, and in order to banish my jealousy you must come back
      immediately...."
    </p>
    <p>
      "我的最後一點，親愛的，是我正在變得嫉妒。
      是的，我知道你愛我，但知道這一點並不能幫助我忘記你總是會碰到那些一定會欣賞和愛你的女人。我害怕想到你可能和她們一起很快樂。我希望你快樂，然而我覺得如果你離開我而快樂，那就是背叛。愛情是多麼無理的事情啊！但在愛情的統治下，嫉妒總是首相，為了消除我的嫉妒，你必須立即回來...."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her pen stopped again. The artifice was too trivial, too palpable, and he
      would certainly see through it. She tore up the sheet and began afresh.
    </p>
    <p>
      她的筆再次停了下來。這種手法太過於瑣碎，也太明顯，他肯定能看穿。她撕毀了那張紙，重新開始。
    </p>
    <p>
      "My last point, dearest, is that I fear you are forgetting me in your
      work. While thinking of the revolution you are making in Europe, you
      forget the revolution you have already made in this poor little heart. Of
      course I love your glory more than I love myself, yet I am afraid it is
      taking you away from me, and will end by leading you up, up, up, out of a
      woman's reach. Why didn't I give you my portrait to put in your watch-case
      when you went away? Don't let this folly disgust you, dearest. A woman is
      a foolish thing, isn't she? But if you don't want me to make a torment of
      everything you will hasten back in time to...."
    </p>
    <p>
      "我最後的觀點，親愛的，是我恐怕你在工作中忘記了我。你在思考你在歐洲帶來的革命時，忘記了你已經在這顆可憐小心中帶來的革命。當然，我愛你的榮耀勝過愛我自己，但我擔心它正在將你從我身邊帶走，將最終把你帶上，上，上，超出一個女人的觸及範圍。為什麼我沒有在你離開時把我的肖像放在你的手錶盒裡？親愛的，不要讓這樣的愚蠢讓你感到厭惡。一個女人真是件愚蠢的事物，不是嗎？但如果你不希望我把任何事情都賴成困擾，你會盡快回來以便....."
    </p>
    <p>
      She threw down the pen and began to cry. Hadn't she promised him that,
      come what would, her love for him should never stand in his way? In the
      midst of her tears a little stab at her heart made her think of something
      else, and she took up the pen again.
    </p>
    <p>
      她扔下筆開始哭泣。難道她沒有答應過他無論發生什麼，她對他的愛絕不會成為他的絆腳石嗎？在淚水中，一種劇烈的痛感在她心中波動，使她想起了另外一件事，於是她又重新拿起了筆。
    </p>
    <p>
      "My last point, dearest, is that I am ill, and very, very anxious to see
      you soon. My health has been failing ever since you left Rome. Perhaps the
      anxieties I have gone through have been partly the cause of this, but I am
      sure that your absence is chiefly responsible, and that no doctor and no
      medicine would be so good for me as one rush into your arms. Therefore
      come and give me back all my health and happiness. Come, I beg of you.
      Leave it to others to do your work abroad. Come at once
      <i>before things have gone too far</i>; come, come, come!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "我最後的觀點，親愛的，是我病了，非常非常渴望儘快見到你。自從你離開羅馬後，我的健康狀況一直在下降。也許我經歷的焦慮部分是造成這種現象的原因，但我確信你的缺席是主要原因，沒有醫生和藥物能像你的懷抱那樣治癒我。因此，請來讓我恢復所有的健康和幸福。我請求你，別再讓其他人去做你在國外的工作。趁事情還沒有太糟糕，馬上來吧，快來，快來，快來！"
    </p>
    <p>
      She hesitated, wanting to say, "Not that I am <i>very</i> ill...." And
      then, "You mustn't come if there is any risk to yourself...." And again,
      "I would never forgive myself if...." But she crushed down her qualms,
      sealed her letter, and sent the Garibaldian to post it.<span
        class="x-ebookmaker-pageno"
        id="pgepubid00423"
        title="332"
        ><a id="Page_332" title="332"></a
      ></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      她猶豫了一下，想說「我其實並不是很病......」然後又想說，「如果對你有任何風險，你就不應該來......」再次，她想說，「如果有什麼事情發生，我永遠不能原諒我自己......」但她壓制住了自己的不安，封起了信，並讓這位加里波第人將信投寄出去。
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she gathered up the entire body of David Rossi's letters, and putting
      some light firewood into the stove she sat on the ground to burn them. It
      was necessary to remove all evidence that could be used against him in the
      event of a domiciliary visitation. One by one as the letters, were passed
      into the fire she read parts of them, and some of the passages seemed to
      stand out afresh in the flames. "Your friend must be a true woman, and it
      was very sweet of you to be so tender with her." ... "There is always a
      little twinge when I read between the lines of your letters. Are you not
      dissimulating?... to keep up my spirits?" ... "You shall smile and recover
      all your girlish spirits.... I shall hear your silvery laugh again as I
      did on that glorious day in the Campagna." ... "It shows how rightly I
      judged the moral elevation of your soul, your impeccability, your spirit
      of fire and your heart of gold."
    </p>
    <p>
      她收起了大衛·羅西的全部信件，放入一些輕木頭進爐子裡，然後坐在地上焚燒它們。為了抵抗可能的家庭搜查，有必要清除所有可能被用來對他不利的證據。一封封信過火，她讀了一部分內容，有些部分在火焰中顯得更加鮮明。“你的朋友必須是一位真正的女性，你對她這麼溫柔真是太甜蜜了。”
      ……
      “每當我閱讀你信中的字裡行間，總是有點疼痛。你是在掩飾自己嗎？……是為了鼓舞我的士氣？”……
      “你將微笑，並恢復所有的少女精神……我將再次聽到你那銀色的笑聲，就像我在大草原那個輝煌的日子一樣。”
      ……
      “它展示了我對你靈魂的道德高度，你的無瑕，你的火焰精神以及你的金色心靈的正確評判。”
    </p>
    <p>
      While the letters were burning she felt herself to be under the influence
      of a kind of delirium. It was almost as though she were committing murder.
    </p>
    <p>
      當信件在燃燒時，她覺得自己像是在一種狂熱的影響之下。這幾乎就像她正在犯下謀殺一樣。

      The Pope had begun the day with the long task of administering the
      sacrament to the lay members of his household, yet at eight o'clock he was
      back in his library in the midst of his morning receptions surrounded by a
      bevy of camerieri, monsignori, and messengers. First came a Cardinal
      Prefect of Propaganda to report the doings of his congregation; then an
      ambassador from Spain to tell of the suppression of religious orders; and
      finally the majordomo to recite the official programme for the public
      ceremonies which the Pope had ordered for Holy Thursday.
    </p>
    <p>
      教宗開始當天的長時間儀式，給他的家庭裡的俗人給予神聖的聖禮。然而在早上八點，他已經回到他的圖書館，身邊都是他的接待人員，包括侍從，教長，和信使。首先來的是宣教部的紅衣主教來匯報他的部門的事務；然後是來自西班牙的大使，來報告有關壓制宗教團體的事情；最後，奧德曼主管來宣讀教宗為聖週四預定的公眾儀式的官方程序。
    </p>
    <p>
      It was now ten o'clock, and Cortis, the valet, brought the usual plate of
      soup. Then came a large man with bold features and dark complexion,
      wearing a purple robe edged with red and a red biretta. It was the
      Cardinal Secretary of State.
    </p>
    <p>
      現在是十點鐘了，僕人Cortis端來了平常的一盤湯。接著，一個面色黝黑、特徵鮮明的大個子進來了，他身著紫色袍子，袍邊繡著紅色，頭戴紅色的小圓帽。這就是樞機主教秘書長。
    </p>
    <p>"What news this morning, your Eminence?" said the Pope.</p>
    <p>"今天早上有什麼新聞，閣下尊貴的樞機主教?"</p>
    <p>
      "The Government," said the Cardinal Secretary, "has just published a
      proclamation announcing a jubilee in honour<span

      of the King's accession. It is to begin on Monday next, and there are to
      be great feasts and rejoicings."
    </p>
    <p>
      "政府," 大主教秘書說,
      "剛剛發布了一項公告，為了國王的登位而宣佈了一次大赦。
      它將從下週一開始，將會有盛大的宴會和慶祝活動。"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A jubilee at a time like this! What a wild mockery of the people's woes!
      How many poor women and children must go hungry before this royal orgy has
      been paid for! God be with us! Such injustice and tyranny in the Satanic
      guise of clemency and indulgence is almost enough to explain the homicidal
      theories of the demagogues and to justify men like Rossi.... Any further
      news of him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      在這種時候舉行慶典！這對人民的苦難來說是多麼野蠻的嘲笑！在這場皇家狂歡付款之前，有多少可憐的婦女和兒童必須挨餓！天佑我們！這種以慈悲和寬容偽裝的不公和壓迫足以解釋煽動家的殺人理論，並證明像羅西這樣的人是正義的....他有進一步的消息嗎？
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. He is at present in Paris, in close intercourse with the leaders of
      every abominable sect."
    </p>
    <p>"是的。他目前正在巴黎，與各種令人討厭的教派的領導人有著密切交往。"</p>
    <p>"You have seen this man Rossi, your Eminence?"</p>
    <p>"閣下有見過這個人羅西嗎？"</p>
    <p>
      "Once. I saw him on the morning of the jubilee of your Holiness, when he
      attempted to present a petition."
    </p>
    <p>"曾經。在您的聖潔慶典的早晨，我見過他，當時他正試圖提出一份請願書。"</p>
    <p>"What is he like to look upon—the typical demagogue; no?"</p>
    <p>"他是什麼樣子的人——典型的煽動者？不是嗎？"</p>
    <p>
      "No. I am bound to say no, your Holiness. And his conversation, though it
      is full of the jargon of modern Liberalism, has none of the obscenities of
      Voltaire."
    </p>
    <p>
      "不，我必須說不，尊者。雖然他的對話充滿了現代自由主義的術語，但他並未像伏爾泰那樣說出下流的語言。"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Some one said ... who was it, I wonder?... some one said he resembled the
      Holy Father."
    </p>
    <p>"有人說...我在想是誰呢？...有人說他看起來像聖父。"</p>
    <p>
      "Now that you mention it, your Holiness, there is perhaps a remote
      resemblance."
    </p>
    <p>"既然您提到了，聖潔的陛下，也許遠遠看去確實有點相似。"</p>
    <p>
      "Ah! who knows what service for God and humanity even such a man might
      have done if in early life his lines had been cast in better places."
    </p>
    <p>
      "啊！如果這樣的人在年輕的時候命運被投向了更好的地方，誰知道他可能對上帝和人類做出什麼樣的服務呢。"
    </p>
    <p>"They say he was an orphan from his infancy, your Holiness."</p>
    <p>"據說他自小就是個孤兒，您的聖潔性。"</p>
    <p>
      "Then he never knew a father's care and guidance! Unhappy son! Unhappy
      father!"
    </p>
    <p>"那麼他從未知道父親的關懷和指導！不幸的兒子！不幸的父親！"</p>
    <p>
      "Monsignor Mario," said the low voice of a chamberlain, and at the next
      moment the Pope's messenger to the Prime Minister was kneeling in the
      middle of the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "閣下馬利奧牧師,"
      一位侍從的低沉聲音說，下一刻，教皇的使者在向總理的地板上跪下。
    </p>
    <p>
      In nervous tones and broken sentences the Monsignor told his story. The
      Pope listened intently, the vertical lines on his forehead deepening and
      darkening every moment, until at length he burst out impatiently:
    </p>
    <p>
      以顫抖的音調和斷斷續續的句子，樞機主教講述了他的故事。教皇全神貫注地聆聽著，他額頭上的垂直皺紋每過一刻就更深、更暗了，直到最後他不耐煩地猛然爆發出來：
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, my son, you do not say that you said all this in addition to your
      message?"
    </p>
    <p>"但是，我的兒子，你是不是說你除了你的資訊外，還說了所有這些？"</p>
    <p>"I was drawn into doing so in defence of your Holiness."</p>
    <p>"我之所以這樣做，是為了保護您的聖潔。"</p>
    <p>
      "You told the Minister that my information came through the channel of a
      simple confidence?"<span

      ></span>
    </p>
    <p>"你告訴部長我的資訊是透過簡單的信任渠道來的嗎？"</p>
    <p>
      "He insinuated that the Holy Father was perhaps breaking the seal of the
      confessional...."
    </p>
    <p>"他暗示聖父可能正在破壞告解的密封...."</p>
    <p>"That my informant was a non-Catholic and a woman?"</p>
    <p>"我的消息來源是非天主教徒和一名女性？"</p>
    <p>
      "He implied that your Holiness had only to command her to reveal the
      conspiracy to the civil authorities, and therefore...."
    </p>
    <p>"他暗示說，你的聖潔只需要命令她向民事當局揭露陰謀，因此...."</p>
    <p>"And you said she was here on Saturday morning?"</p>
    <p>"你說她星期六早上在這裡嗎？"</p>
    <p>
      "He hinted that the Holy Father was an accomplice of criminals if he had
      known this without revealing it before, and that was why...."
    </p>
    <p>
      "他暗示，如果教宗知道這一切卻未能提前揭示，那麼他就是罪犯的同謀，這就是為什麼...."
    </p>
    <p>"And she came in at that moment, you say?"</p>
    <p>"你說她就在那一刻進來了嗎？"</p>
    <p>
      "At that very moment, your Holiness, and said she had met me on Saturday
      morning."
    </p>
    <p>"就在那一刻，你的殿下，她說她在星期六的早晨遇見了我。"</p>
    <p>
      "Man, man, what have you done?" cried the Pope, rising from his seat and
      pacing the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "天啊，人啊，你做了什麼？"教宗驚呼，從他的座位上起身，在房間裡走來走去。
    </p>
    <p>
      The chamberlain continued to kneel in utter humility, until the Pope,
      recovering his composure, put both hands on his shoulders and raised him
      to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "侍從在極度謙卑的狀態下繼續跪著，直到教皇恢復了鎮定，雙手放在他的肩膀上並讓他站起來。"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Forgive me, my son. I was more to blame than you were. It was wrong to
      trust any one with a verbal message in the cabinet of a fox. The Holy
      Father should have no intercourse with such persons. But this is God's
      hand. Let us leave everything to the Holy Spirit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "原諒我，我的兒子。比起你，我更應該負責。在狐狸的內閣中信任任何人的語言訊息都是錯誤的。教皇應該不與這種人有任何交往。但這是上帝的意旨。讓我們將一切交給聖靈。"
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment the Papal Majordomo returned with a letter. It was the
      Baron's letter to the Pope. After the Pope had read it he stepped into a
      little adjoining room which contained nothing but a lounge and an
      easy-chair. There he lay on the lounge and turned his face to the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      在那一刻，教宗的大管家帶回了一封信。這是男爵給教宗的信。教宗讀完之後，他走進了一個小房間，那裡只有一張長躺椅和一張舒適的椅子。他躺在長榻上，臉向著牆壁。

    <p>
      At four o'clock in the afternoon the Pope and Father Pifferi were again
      walking in the garden. The groves of Judas trees were shedding their
      crimson blossoms and the path had a covering of bloom; the atmosphere was
      full of the odour of honey-suckle and violet, and through the sunlit air
      the swallows were darting with shrill cries and the glitter of wings.
    </p>
    <p>
      下午四點，教皇和Pifferi神父再次在花園中散步。猶大樹的樹叢正在落下他們的猩紅色的花朵，路徑上覆蓋著花瓣;
      空氣中充滿了金銀花和紫羅蘭的香氣，在陽光照耀的空氣中，燕子們正尖叫著飛翔，翅膀閃著光芒.
    </p>
    <p>"And what does your Holiness intend to do?" asked the Capuchin.</p>
    <p>"那麼，你的神聖意欲何為呢？”閣下問道。</p>
    <p>
      "Providence will direct us," said the Pope with a sigh.<span

      ></span>
    </p>
    <p>"天意會指引我們，"教皇歎息道。</p>
    <p>"But your Holiness will refuse the request of the Government?"</p>
    <p>"但是,您的聖潔會拒絕政府的請求嗎?"</p>
    <p>
      "How can I do so without exposing myself to misunderstanding? Suppose the
      King is assassinated, what then? The Government will tell the world that
      the Pope knew all and did nothing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "我如何能做到不讓自己被誤解呢？假設國王被暗殺，那又將如何？政府將告訴世界，教皇全部都知道卻什麼也沒做。"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let them. It will not be an incident without parallel in the history of
      the Church. And the world will only honour your Holiness the more for
      standing firm on your sanctity of the human soul."
    </p>
    <p>
      "讓他們這麼做吧。在教會的歷史中，這並非是無前例的事件。世界只會因為您堅定地捍衛人類靈魂的神聖不可侵犯而更加尊重您的聖潔。"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, if the confessional were in question. The world knows that the seal
      of the confessional is sacred, and must be observed at all costs. But this
      is not a case of the confessional."
    </p>
    <p>
      "是的，如果這們是告解的問題。全世界都知道，告解的封印是神聖的，無論如何都必須遵守。但這並非告解的情況。"
    </p>
    <p>"Didn't your Holiness say you would observe it as such?"</p>
    <p>"你的聖潔不是說你會這樣觀察嗎？"</p>
    <p>
      "And I shall. But what about the public? Accident has told the Government
      that this is not a case of the confessional, and the Government will tell
      the world. What follows? If I refuse to do anything the enemies of the
      Church will give it out that the Holy Father is an accomplice of a
      regicide, ready and willing to intrigue with the agents of rebellion to
      regain the temporal power."
    </p>
    <p>
      "而我也將會這麼做。但是，公眾如何看待呢？意外揭示了這不是懺悔的情況，政府將會告知全世界。接著會發生什麼呢？如果我拒絕做任何事，教會的敵人會散播這個謠言，說教宗是一個刺客的共犯，準備並願意與造反的代理人密謀，以重新獲得世俗的權力。"
    </p>
    <p>"Then you will receive the Prime Minister?"</p>
    <p>"那麼你將會接見總理嗎？"</p>
    <p>"No! Or if so, only in the company of his superior."</p>
    <p>"不！或者如果是，只能在他的上級的陪同下。"</p>
    <p>"The King?"</p>
    <p>"國王?"</p>
    <p>"Yes."</p>
    <p>"是的。"</p>
    <p>
      The Capuchin removed his skull-cap with an uneasy hand, and walked some
      paces without speaking.
    </p>
    <p>這個卡普錫恩用不安的手移開了他的頭骨帽，然後走了幾步而沒有說話。</p>
    <p>"Will he come, your Holiness?"</p>
    <p>"他會來嗎，神聖的人?"</p>
    <p>
      "If he thinks I hold the secret on which his life depends, assuredly he
      will come."
    </p>
    <p>"如果他認為我握有他生命所依賴的秘密，他肯定會來的。"</p>
    <p>
      "But you are sovereign as well as Pope—is it possible for you to receive
      him?"
    </p>
    <p>"但是你既是君主又是教宗，你有可能接待他嗎？"</p>
    <p>
      "I will receive him as the King of Sardinia, the King of Italy, if you
      will, but not as the King of Rome."
    </p>
    <p>
      "我會以薩丁尼亞國王，甚至義大利國王的身份接待他，但不會以羅馬國王的身份接待他。"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Capuchin took his coloured handkerchief from his sleeve and rolled it
      in his palms, which were hot and perspiring.
    </p>
    <p>
      這位卡普奇諾僧依從他的袖子裡拿出他的彩色手帕，並在他的手掌中捲動，那裡熱且滲出汗水。
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, Holy Father," he said, "what will be the good? Say that all
      difficulties of etiquette can be removed, and you can meet as man to man,
      as David Leone and Albert Charles—why will the King come? Only to ask you
      to put pressure upon your informant to give more information."<span

      "但是，神聖的父親，"他說，"這有什麼好處呢？說所有的禮節問題都可以解決，你可以像男人與男人，像大衛利奧內和阿爾伯特查理斯那樣見面，國王會來是為了什麼呢？只是要求你對你的消息提供者施加更多的壓力以獲取更多的資訊。"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Pope drew himself up on the gravel path and smote his breast with
      indignation. "Never! It would be an insult to the Church," he said. "It is
      one thing to expect the Holy Father to do his duty as a Christian even to
      his enemy, it is another thing to ask him to invade the sanctity of a
      private confidence."
    </p>
    <p>
      教宗在碎石路上挺直腰桿，滿懷憤慨地捶擊自己的胸膛。他說："絕不！那將是對教會的侮辱。期望教宗作為基督徒，即使對他的敵人也要履行職責是一回事，要求他侵犯私人信任的神聖是另一回事。"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Capuchin did not reply, and the two old men walked on in silence. As
      the light softened the swallows increased their clamour, and song-birds
      began to call from neighbouring trees. Suddenly a startled cry burst from
      the foliage, and, turning quickly, the Pope lifted up the cat which, as
      usual, was picking its way at his heels.
    </p>
    <p>
      `卡布奇諾修士沒有回答，兩位老人一言不發地繼續走著。隨著光線的柔和，燕子的叫聲愈演愈烈，附近的樹上也開始傳來雀鳥的啼鳴。忽然一聲驚嚇的尖叫從樹叢中傳出，教皇迅速轉身，把那隻如同往常一樣跟在他腳後的貓抱起來。`
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, Meesh, Meesh! I've got you safely this time.... It was the poor
      mother-bird again, I suppose. Where is her nest, I wonder?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "啊，Meesh，Meesh！這次我終於抓住你了...這又是那隻可憐的母鳥吧，我在想。她的巢在哪裡呢，我想知道呢?"
    </p>
    <p>
      They found it in the old sarcophagus, which was now almost lost in leaves.
      The eggs had been hatched, and the fledglings, with eyes not yet opened,
      stretched their featherless necks and opened their beaks when the Pope put
      down his hand to touch them.
    </p>
    <p>
      他們在幾乎被樹葉掩蓋的古老石棺中找到它。蛋已經孵化，而小雛鳥的眼睛還未張開，它們無羽的脖子伸得很長，當教皇伸手去碰它們時，小雛鳥們張開了嘴巴。
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monsignor," said the Pope over his shoulder, "remind me to-morrow to ask
      the gardener for some worms."
    </p>
    <p>"主教，"教皇越過他的肩膀說，"提醒我明天向園丁要一些蟲子。"</p>
    <p>
      The cat, from his prison under the Pope's arm, was watching the squirming
      nest with hungry eyes.
    </p>
    <p>那隻貓，從教皇腕下的囚籠裡，正用饑餓的眼睛注視著那個蠕動的巢。</p>
    <p>
      "Naughty Meesh! Naughty!" said the Pope, shaking one finger in the cat's
      face. "But Meesh is only following the ways of his kind, and perhaps I was
      wrong to let him see the quarry."
    </p>
    <p>
      "壞孩子，Meesh！壞孩子！"教皇搖晃著一根手指對著貓的臉說。"但Meesh只是跟隨他的種族的方式，或許我讓他看到獵物是我錯了。"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Pope and the Capuchin walked back to the Vatican for joy of the sweet
      spring evening with its scent of flowers and song of birds.
    </p>
    <p>
      教皇與卡普奇諾修士在甜蜜的春天夜晚，花香與鳥鳴中，快樂地散步回到梵蒂岡。
    </p>
    <p>"You are sad to-day, Father Pifferi," said the Pope.</p>
    <p>"您今天似乎很沮喪，Pifferi神父," 教皇說。</p>
    <p>"I'm still thinking of that poor lady," said the Capuchin.</p>
    <p>"我還在想那位可憐的女士," 那位隱士說。</p>
    <p>
      At the first hour of night the Pope attended the recitation of the rosary
      in his private chapel, and then returning to his private study, a room
      furnished with a table and two chairs, he took a light supper, served by
      Cortis in the evening dress of a civilian. His only other company was the
      cat, which sat on a chair on the opposite side of the table. After supper
      he wrote a letter. It ran:
    </p>
    <p>
      `在夜晚的第一個小時，教皇在他的私人禱告室參加了玫瑰經的誦讀，然後回到他的私人書房，這是一個配有一張桌子和兩把椅子的房間，他享用了由Cortis穿著平民的晚裝提供的輕便晚餐。他唯一的陪伴是坐在桌子對面椅子上的貓。晚餐過後他寫了一封信。封信的內容是：`

      and believing that we can give information that will help him to defeat so
      vile a conspiracy, he asks us for a special audience. It is not within our
      power to promise more assistance than we have already given; but this is
      to say that if your Majesty yourself should wish to see us, we shall be
      pleased to receive you, with or without your Minister, if you will come in
      private and otherwise unattended, at the hour of 21-1/2 on Holy Thursday,
      to the door of the Canons' House of St. Peter's, where the bearer of this

      The ceremonies in St. Peter's on Maundy Thursday exceeded in pomp and
      magnificence anything that could be remembered in Rome.

    <p>
      在聖彼得大教堂的聖週四儀式的隆重和壯麗超過了羅馬人所能記憶的任何事情。

    <p>
      It was a great triumph for the Church. In the face of the anti-religious
      Governments of Europe she had proved that the mightiest sentiment of the
      people was the sentiment of religion.

    <p>
      這是教會的一次偉大勝利。面對歐洲的反宗教政府，她證明了人民最強大的情感是宗教情感。

    <p>
      The Papal Court was proud of itself. Some of its members made no effort to
      conceal their delight at the blow they had struck at the ruling classes.
      But there was one man in Rome who felt no joy in his triumph. It was the
      Pope.

      教皇庭院感到自豪。其中一些成員毫不掩飾他們對打擊統治階級的喜悅。但在羅馬有一個人對他的勝利沒有任何喜悅。那就是教皇。

      At nine o'clock at night he visited the "urn" called the "Sepulchre."
      Borne amid the light of torches on his <i>sedia</i> with his
      <i>flabelli</i> waving on either hand, under a white canopy upheld by
      prelates, he passed through the glittering rooms of his own palace, along
      the dark corridors of the Vatican and down the marble stairs, accompanied
      by his guards in helmets and preceded by the papal cross covered with a
      violet veil, into the great Basilica, lit only by large candles in iron
      stands, and looking plain and barn-like and full of shadows in the gloom
      and the smoky air. But after he had visited the Sepulchre, gorgeously
      illuminated, while the cantors sang the <i>Verbum Caro</i>, after he had
      knelt in silence and had risen, and the torches of his procession had been
      put out, and he had returned to his chair to be borne into the Sacristy,
      and the poor people, lifted to a height of emotion not often reached by
      the human soul, had broken again into a last delirious shout of affection,
      he dropped his head and wept.<span

      在晚上九點，他前往被稱為“聖墓”的“甕”。在火炬的照耀中，他坐在自己的轎子上，兩邊揮著扇風機，由主教扶著白色的天篷，穿過自己宮殿的燦爛房間，沿著梵蒂岡的黑暗走廊，下著大理石的樓梯，由戴著頭盔的衛士陪同，在被紫羅蘭面紗遮蓋的教皇十字架前行，進入只由大鐵架上的大蠟燭照亮的大教堂，在昏暗與煙霧的空氣中，教堂看起來像個簡樸、像倉庫一般，充滿了陰影。但是在他參觀了那個華麗照明的聖墓之後，唱詩班在唱著‘道成肉身’，他跪下沉默，再次站起來，他的行列熄滅了火炬，他回到了自己的椅子上，被抬入禮品房，而那些窮人們，在情感高度上達到人類靈魂罕有的高度後，他們再一次爆發出對他的最後瘋狂的熱愛呼喊，他低頭哭泣。
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment the Sacristy was empty save for the custodian in black
      cassock and biretta, who was warming his hands over a large bronze
      scaldino; but in the Archpriest's room adjoining, with its gilt arm-chair
      and stools of red plush, Father Pifferi in his ordinary brown habit was
      waiting for the Pope. The bearers put down the chair, knelt and kissed the
      Pope's feet in spite of his protest, backed themselves out with deep
      obeisance, and left the two old men together.
    </p>
    <p>
      那一刻，除了一位身穿黑色法衣、頭戴小圓帽、正在一個大型銅製保溫爐前為雙手取暖的看守人外，教堂內空無一人。但是在接壤的大祭司的房間裡，有著金色扶手椅和紅色絨面凳子，身穿普通棕色袍服的
      Father
      Pifferi正在等待教皇。擔架工人放下椅子，跪地吻教皇的腳，儘管教皇反對，他們仍然以深重的禮貌退出，讓兩位老人單獨待在一起。
    </p>
    <p>"Have they arrived?" asked the Pope.</p>
    <p>“他們已經到了嗎？”教皇問。</p>
    <p>"Not yet, your Holiness," said the Capuchin.</p>
    <p>"您的聖潔，還沒有呢，"那位卡普奇諾說。</p>
    <p>"Father, have you any faith in presentiments?"</p>
    <p>"父親，您對預感有信心嗎？"</p>
    <p>"Sometimes, your Holiness. When they continue and are persistent..."</p>
    <p>"有時候，尊敬的聖人。當他們持續並且堅持不懈的時候..."</p>
    <p>
      "I have had a presentiment which has been with me all my life—all my life
      as Pope, at all events. The blessed God who abases and lifts up has
      thought fit to raise my lowliness to the most sublime dignity that exists
      on earth, but I have always lived in the fear that some day I should be
      torn down from it, and the Church would suffer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "我一生中總有一種預感—至少在我擔任教皇的這段時間。那位能使人卑微並能尊崇人的神靈註定要將我這樣的卑微者提升到地上最崇高的尊嚴地位，但我一直生活在恐懼之中，擔心有一天我會被從這個地位上推下來，並且教會會受到傷害。"
    </p>
    <p>"God forbid, your Holiness!"</p>
    <p>"天哪，您的聖潔!"</p>
    <p>
      "That was why I refused every place and every honour. You know how I
      refused them, Father!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "那就是我拒絕所有位置和每一份榮譽的原因。你知道我是怎麼拒絕它們的，父親！"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, but God knew better, your Holiness, and He preserved you to be a
      blessing and a comfort to His people."
    </p>
    <p>"是的，但上帝更明白，您的聖潔，他保護你成為他的人民的祝福和安慰。"</p>
    <p>
      "His holy will be done! But the shadow which has been over me will not be
      lifted. Cause prayers to be said for me. Pray for me yourself, Father."
    </p>
    <p>
      "願他的聖意成全！但是已經籠罩我的陰影不會消散。為我祈禱吧，為我自己祈禱，父親。"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your Holiness is in low spirits. And to-day of all days! Ah, how happy is
      the Church which has seen the hand of God place in the chair of St. Peter
      a soul capable of comprehending the necessities of His children and a
      heart desirous of satisfying them!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "您的聖潔心情低落，而且就在今天這樣的日子！啊，那些看到上帝的手在聖彼得的椅子上放下一個能夠理解他的子女們需要的靈魂，以及一個渴望滿足他們的心的教堂是多麼的幸福！"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hardly know what is to come of this interview, Father, but I must leave
      myself in the hands of the Holy Spirit."
    </p>
    <p>"我幾乎不知道這次訪談將會如何，父親，但我必須將自己交由聖靈之手。"</p>
    <p>"There is no help for it now, your Holiness."</p>
    <p>"現在無法得到任何幫助了，尊貴的聖座。"</p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps I should not have gone so far but for this wave of anarchy which
      is sweeping over the world.... You believe the man Rossi is secretly an
      anarchist?"

      "也許我不應該走這麼遠，但這股席捲全球的無政府主義浪潮讓我無法輕易罷休.....你認為羅西這個人其實是秘密的無政府主義者嗎？"

      "I am afraid he is, your Holiness, and one of the worst enemies of the
      Church and the Holy Father."

    <p>"他與那位女士的關係，似乎確實如此，陛下。"</p>
    <p>
      "But the Holy Father may be sorry for a wayward son, and yet be forced to
      condemn him for all that. He must cut himself off from all such men, lest
      his adversaries should say that, while preaching peace and the moral law,
      he is secretly encouraging the devilish agents of atheism, anarchy, and
      rebellion."
    </p>
    <p>
      "但是，聖父可能會對一個誤入歧途的兒子感到遺憾，儘管如此，他還是被迫譴責他。他必須與所有這些人斷絕關係，以免他的對手說，他一邊宣揚和平與道德法則，一邊秘密鼓勵無神論、無政府狀態和反叛的魔鬼般的代理人。"

    <p>"Perhaps so, your Holiness."</p>
    <p>"也許吧，陛下。"</p>

      The King sat on one of the wooden stools in front of the Pope, but the
      Baron continued to stand by his side. Between the Pope and the King was a
      wooden table on which two large candles were burning. The young King was
      pale, and the expression of his twitching face was one of pain.

      `國王坐在教皇前的一張木凳上，但男爵仍然站在他身邊。教皇與國王之間有一張木桌，桌上燃燒著兩支大蠟燭。年輕的國王臉色蒼白，他扭曲的臉上露出痛苦的表情。`

      "It was good of your Holiness to see us," he said, "and perhaps the
      gravity of our errand may excuse the informality of our visit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "您的聖潔能夠見我們，真是太好了，"他說，"也許我們使命的重大可以原諒我們訪問的非正式性。"

      The Pope, who was leaning forward on the arms of his chair, only bent his
      head.

      "尊敬的閣下，"國王指著男爵說，"告訴我，他已經取得證據，證明有一個有組織的陰謀想要謀害我的生命，並且他說您的聖潔擁有這些陰謀者的秘密。"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Pope, without responding, looked steadily into the face of the young
      King, who became nervous and embarrassed.
    </p>
    <p>教宗沒有回答，只是堅定地看著年輕國王的臉，使他感到緊張和尷尬。</p>
    <p>
      "Not that I'm afraid," he said, "personally afraid. But naturally I must
      think of others—my family—my people—even of Italy—and if your
      Holiness...if your...your Holiness..."
    </p>
    <p>
      "我並不是出於個人的恐懼，"他說，"但自然，我必須考慮其他人—我的家人—我的人民—甚至於義大利—如果你的聖潔……如果你的……你的聖潔……"

    <p>
      The Baron, who had been standing with one arm across his breast, and the
      other supporting his chin, intervened at this moment.
    </p>
    <p>"男爵先生此時跨臂抱胸，一手托著下巴，選擇在這個時間點介入。"</p>
    <p>
      "Your Majesty," he said, "with your Majesty's permission, and that of his
      Holiness," he bowed to both sovereigns, "it may be convenient if I state
      shortly the object of our visit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "陛下,"他說,"經過陛下和聖潔的許可,"他向兩位君主鞠躬,"如果我簡短地陳述我們來訪的目的，可能會更便利。"

      The young King drew a breath of relief, and the Pope, who was still
      silent, bent his head again.
    </p>
    <p>年輕的國王鬆了一口氣，而依然保持沉默的教皇再次低下了他的頭。</p>
    <p>
      "Some days ago your Holiness was good enough to warn his Majesty's
      Government that from private sources of information you had reason to fear
      that an assault against the public peace was to be attempted."
    </p>
    <p>
      "幾天前，您的聖潔好心告誡我們國王的政府，您從私人訊息來源中有理由擔心公共安全將遭到攻擊。"
    </p>
    <p>The Pope once more assented.</p>
    <p>教皇再次同意。</p>
    <p>
      "Since then the Government has received corroboration of the gracious
      message of your Holiness, coupled with very definite predictions of the
      nature of the revolt intended. In short, we have been told by our
      correspondents abroad that a conspiracy of European proportions, involving
      the subversive elements of England, France, and Germany, is to be directed
      against Rome as a centre of revolution, and that an attempt is to be made
      to assail constituted society by striking at our King."
    </p>
    <p>
      "自那時以來，我們的政府已經獲得了有關您的殿下慈悲為懷的訊息的確認，並且與此相配的是非常明確的反叛性質的預測。簡而言之，我們從海外的通訊記者那裡得知，一個涉及到英格蘭，法國和德國的顛覆性元素的歐洲規模的陰謀，將以羅馬為革命中心來指導，並且將嘗試透過攻擊我們的國王來進攻社會制度。"
    </p>
    <p>"Well, sir?"</p>
    <p>"那麼，先生？"</p>
    <p>
      "Your Holiness may have heard that it is the intention of the Government
      and the nation to honour the anniversary of his Majesty's accession by a
      festival. The anniversary falls on Monday next, and we have reason to fear
      that Monday is the day intended for the outbreak of this vile conspiracy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "尊貴的聖潔，您可能已經聽說政府和全國人民打算用一個慶祝活動來紀念陛下加冕的週年紀念日。週年紀念日在下週一就要到來，我們有理由擔心下週一會是這場惡劣陰謀的爆發日。"
    </p>
    <p>"Well?"</p>
    <p>"好嗎？"</p>

    </p>
    <p>
      "If your Government knows all this, it has its remedy—let it alter the
      King's plans."
    </p>
    <p>
      "如果你們的政府知道所有這些，那麼它有它的解決方法—讓它改變國王的計劃。"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The advice with which your Holiness honours us is scarcely practicable.
      For the Government to alter the King's plans would be to alarm the
      populace, demoralise the services, and to add to the unhappy excitement
      which it is the object of the festival allay."
    </p>
    <p>
      "你的聖潔賜予我們的忠告幾乎是無法實施的。政府改變國王的計劃，將會使群眾恐慌，使服務人員士氣低落，並將加劇那種不幸的興奮感，而這種興奮感正是節慶活動所要平息的目標。"
    </p>
    <p>"But why do you come to me?"</p>
    <p>"但你為什麼來找我?"</p>
    <p>
      "Because, your Holiness, our information, although conclusive, is too
      indefinite for effective action, and we believe your Holiness can supply
      the means by which we may preserve public order, and"—with an apologetic
      gesture—"save the life of the King."
    </p>
    <p>
      "因為，尊敬的教宗，我們的資訊雖然是確定的，但過於含糊以至於無法有效地採取行動，我們相信您的聖liness可以提供我們維護公共秩序的方法，並"—以一個道歉的姿勢—"拯救國王的生命。"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Pope was moving uneasily in his chair. "I will ask you to be good
      enough to speak more plainly," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      教皇在椅子上坐得不是很舒服。他說：“我要求你有足夠的善意來說得更明白些。”
    </p>
    <p>
      The Baron's heavy moustache rose at one corner to a fleeting smile. "Your
      Holiness," he said, "is already aware that accident disclosed to us the
      source of your information. It was a lady. This knowledge enabled us to
      judge who was the subject of her communication. It was the lady's lover.
      Official channels give us proof that he is engaged abroad in plots against
      public order, and thus..."
    </p>
    <p>
      `男爵粗重的鬍子在一角飄起一絲短暫的微笑。
      "尊烈的陛下，"他說，"已然知道偶然之間揭示給我們的您的消息來源。那是一位女士。有了這個知識，我們便能判斷誰是她溝通的對象。那就是那位女士的戀人。官方渠道給我們提供了證據表明他在國外參與了破壞公共秩序的陰謀，因此..."`

    <p>"If you know all this, sir, what do you want with me?"</p>
    <p>"如果您全都知道，先生，那您還需要我做什麼呢？"</p>
    <p>
      "Your Holiness may not be aware that the person in question is a Deputy,
      and that a Deputy cannot be arrested without the fulfilment of various
      conditions prescribed by law. One of those conditions is that some one
      should be in a position to denounce him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "閣下可能不知道，問題的人是一名副手，並且副手在未滿足法律規定的各種條件下不能被逮捕。其中一個條件是有人能夠指控他。"
    </p>
    <p>The Pope half rose from his chair. "You ask me to denounce him?"</p>
    <p>教皇從他的椅子上半起身。 “你要我譴責他？”</p>
    <p>
      The Baron bowed very low. "The Government does not presume so far," he
      said. "It only hopes that your Holiness will require your informant to do
      so."
    </p>
    <p>
      男爵非常低頭。“政府並未如此妄自尊大，”他說。“它只希望你的聖潔可以要求你的消息來源這麼做。”
    </p>
    <p>"Then you want me to outrage a confidence?"</p>
    <p>"那麼你是希望我背信棄義嗎？"</p>
    <p>
      "It was not a confession, your Holiness, and even if it had been, as your
      Holiness knows better than we do, it would not be without precedent to
      reveal the facts which are necessary to be known in order to prevent
      crime."
    </p>
    <p>
      "這並非是一種告解，聖潔的閣下，即使它是，正如閣下比我們更瞭解的，為了防止罪行，透露必須知道的事實並無先例可循。"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Capuchin's sandals were scraping on the floor, but the Pope raised his
      left hand, and the friar fell back.
    </p>
    <p>
      卡普奇諾的涼鞋在地板上劃過，但是教皇舉起了他的左手，僧侶立刻退了後來。

      hand was raised again.
    </p>
    <p>"思考？”卡普奇林的聲音充滿了憤怒，但教皇的左手再次升起。</p>
    <p>
      "In short, sir, you ask me to require the wife to sacrifice her husband."
    </p>
    <p>總之，先生，您是要我要求妻子犧牲她的丈夫。</p>
    <p>
      "If your Holiness calls it so,—to perform an act that will preserve the
      public peace...."

    <p>"如果您的聖潔如此稱呼它，那就是去執行一個可以保持公共和平的行為...."</p>
    <p>"I <i>do</i> call it so."</p>
    <p>"我的確是這麼說的。"</p>
    <p>
      The Baron bowed, the young King was restless, and there was a moment's
      silence. Then the Pope said:
    </p>
    <p>男爵鞠躬，年輕的國王坐立難安，一時之間陷入了寂靜。然後，教皇說：</p>
    <p>
      "Putting aside the extreme unlikelihood that the lady knows more than she
      has said, and we have already communicated, what possible inducement do
      you expect us to offer her that she should sacrifice her husband?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "拋開那位女士可能知道的比她說的更多的極度不可能性，我們已經進行過溝通，你認為我們應該提供什麼樣的誘因，讓她捨棄自己的丈夫呢？"
    </p>
    <p>"Her husband's life," said the Baron.</p>
    <p>"她的丈夫的生活,"男爵說。</p>
    <p>"His life?"</p>
    <p>"他的生活？"</p>
    <p>
      "Your Holiness may not know that the Governments of Europe, having
      ascertained the existence of a widespread plot against civil society, have
      joined in measures of repression. One of these is the extension to all
      countries of what is called the Belgian clause in treaties, whereby
      persons guilty of regicide or of plots directed against the lives of
      sovereigns are made liable to extradition."
    </p>
    <p>
      "尊敬的聖潔可能不知道，歐洲各國政府已經確定了針對公民社會的廣泛陰謀的存在，因此聯手採取了壓制措施。其中一項是將被稱為比利時條款的條約條款延伸到所有國家，根據這些條款，對君主犯有弒君或策劃陰謀的人將受到引渡的威脅。"
    </p>
    <p>"Well?"</p>
    <p>"好嗎？"</p>
    <p>
      "The Deputy Rossi is now in Berlin. If he were denounced with the
      conditions required by law as conspiring against the life of the King, we
      might have him arrested to-night and brought back as a common murderer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "現在，羅西副議長正在柏林。如果他被合法地揭露為陰謀謀殺國王，我們可能可以在今晚逮捕他，並作為普通的殺人兇手把他帶回來。"
    </p>
    <p>"Well?"</p>
    <p>"好嗎？"</p>
    <p>
      "Your Holiness may not have heard that since the late unhappy riots the
      Parliament, in spite of the protests of his Majesty, has re-established
      capital punishment for all forms of high treason."
    </p>
    <p>
      "尊敬的教宗可能還沒有聽說，自從最近的那場不幸的暴動以來，在國王的抗議聲中，國會已經重新立法對所有形式的重大叛國行為實行死刑。"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Therefore," said the Pope, "if the wife were to denounce her husband for
      participation in this conspiracy he would be sentenced to death."
    </p>
    <p>"所以，"教皇說，"如果妻子告發她的丈夫參與這場陰謀，他將被判處死刑。"</p>
    <p>
      "For this conspiracy—yes," said the Baron. "But the present is not the
      only conspiracy the man Rossi has engaged in. Eighteen years ago he was
      condemned in contumacy for conspiracy against the life of the late King.
      He has not yet suffered for his crime, because of the difficulty of
      bringing it home. In that case, as in this, there is only one person known
      to the authorities who can fulfil the conditions required by law. That
      person is the informant of your Holiness."<span

    </p>
    <p>
      "對於這場陰謀 — 沒錯，"男爵說。 "但現在並不是 Rossi
      先生唯一參與的陰謀。十八年前，他因陰謀謀殺已故國王而在缺席時被判刑。由於證實他的罪行的難度，他尚未因他的罪行受苦。在那種情況下，就像在這種情況下一樣，只有一個人是當局所知道的，可以滿足法律所要求的條件。那個人就是你的神聖性的告密者。"
    </p>
    <p>"Well?"</p>
    <p>"好嗎？"</p>
    <p>
      "If your Holiness can prevail upon the lady to identify her lover as the
      man condemned for the former conspiracy, you will be helping her to save
      her husband's life from the penalty due for the present one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "如果您的聖潔能夠說服那位女士將她的情人認定為先前陰謀案的被判罪者，您將能夠幫助她救命她的丈夫，免於為目前的陰謀案承擔應有的刑責。"

    <p>"How so?"</p>
    <p>"怎麼這樣?"</p>
    <p>
      "His Majesty is willing to promise your Holiness that, whatever the result
      of a new trial in assize to follow the old one in contumacy, he will grant
      a complete pardon."
    </p>
    <p>
      "陛下願意向您的聖潔保證，不論新的巡迴法庭審訊（以取代老的冒犯審訊）的結果如何，他都將授予完全的寬恕。"
    </p>
    <p>"And then?"</p>
    <p>"那麼呢？"</p>

      "Then the Deputy Rossi will be banished, the threatened conspiracy will be
      crushed, the public peace will be preserved, and the King's life will be
      saved."

      "然後，羅西副將被流放，威脅的陰謀將被粉碎，公共和平將得到維護，國王的生命將會得到保護。"

      The Pope leaned forward on the arms of his chair, but he did not speak,
      and there was silence for some moments.

    <p>教宗前傾於他的座椅扶手上，但他並未說詞，幾分鐘的時間裡一片寂靜。</p>
    <p>
      "Thus your Holiness must see," said the Baron suavely, "that, in asking
      you to obtain the denunciation of the man Rossi, the Government is only
      looking to your Holiness to fulfil the mission of mercy to which your
      venerated position has destined you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "因此，您的神聖必須看到，"男爵平順地說，“當政府要求您譴責羅西先生時，政府只是希望您的崇高地位能夠完成您的憐憫使命。”
    </p>
    <p>"And if I refused to exercise this mission of mercy?"</p>
    <p>"如果我拒絕執行這個施憐的使命呢？"</p>
    <p>The Baron bowed gravely. "Your Holiness will not refuse," he said.</p>
    <p>男爵恭敬地鞠躬，“您的神聖不會拒絕”，他說。</p>
    <p>"But if I do—what then?"</p>
    <p>"但如果我這麼做了——那會怎樣呢?"</p>
    <p>"Then ... your Holiness.... I was about to say something."</p>

    <p>"我正在聽。"</p>

      him aside from his purpose, which is to overthrow Society and the Church."

      "Naturally the Government wishes if possible to spare your Holiness an
      unusual and painful ordeal."
    </p>
    <p>"當然，政府希望如果可能的話，免您聖潔的典禮進行不尋常且痛苦的折磨。”</p>
    <p>"The lady has resisted all other influences?"</p>
    <p>"這位女士抵抗了所有其他的影響嗎?"</p>
    <p>
      "She has resisted all influences which can be brought to bear upon her by
      the proper authorities."
    </p>
    <p>"她抵抗了所有由合適的當局所施加的影響。"</p>
    <p>
      "I have heard of it, sir. I have heard what your 'authorities' have done
      to humble a helpless woman. She had been the victim of a heartless man,
      and by knowledge of that fact your 'authorities' have tempted and tried
      her. They tried her with poverty, with humiliation, with jealousy and the
      shadow of shame. But the blessed God upheld her in the love which had
      awakened her soul, and she withstood them to the last."
    </p>
    <p>
      "我已經聽說了，先生。我聽說你們的'當權者'對一個無助的女人所做的事。她曾是一個無情男子的受害者，而你們的'當權者'利用這個事實來誘惑和考驗她。他們用貧窮，屈辱，嫉妒和恥辱的陰影來試驗她。但是，神聖的上帝在愛中支持她，喚醒了她的靈魂，她到最後都抵抗了他們。"

    <p>"男爵，首次顯得困惑。"</p>
    <p>
      "I have also heard that in order to achieve the same end one of your gaols
      has been the scene of a scandal which has outraged every divine and human
      law."
    </p>
    <p>
      "我也聽說，為了達到相同的目的，你們的一個監獄成為了一場醜聞的舞臺，這樣的行為激怒了所有神聖的和人類的法律。"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your Holiness must not accept for truth all that is printed in the
      halfpenny papers."
    </p>
    <p>"聖潔的您，不能接受半便士報紙上印刷的所有內容為真實的。"</p>
    <p>
      "Is it true that in the cell where a helpless unfortunate was paying the
      penalty of his crime your 'authorities' introduced a police agent in
      disguise to draw him into a denunciation of his accomplice?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "請問真的有人在牢房裡向一個無助的不幸者付出他的罪行的代價時，你們的'當局'派遣了一名偽裝的警察去引誘他揭發他的共犯嗎?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "These are matters of state, your Holiness. I do not assert them and I do
      not deny."
    </p>
    <p>"這些是國家事務，閣下聖人。我既不主張也不否認。"</p>
    <p>
      "In the name of humanity I ask you are such 'authorities' punished, or do
      they sit in the cabinets of your Ministers of the Interior?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "我以人道的名義問你，這種'權威'會被懲罰嗎，還是他們坐在你們內政部長的辦公室裡？"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No doubt the officials went too far, your Holiness; but shall we, for the
      sake of a miserable malefactor who told one story to-day and another
      to-morrow, drag our public service through courts of law? Pity for such
      persons is morbid sentimentality, your Holiness, unworthy of a strong and
      enlightened Government."
    </p>
    <p>
      "毫無疑問，官員們的行為已經過於矯枉過正，聖者；但是，我們是否應該為了一個可憐的罪犯，他今天講一個故事，明天講另一個，將我們的公共服務拖入法庭？對這樣的人的憐憫是一種病態的情懷，聖者，這不配一個強大且開明的政府。"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then God destroy all such Governments, sir, and the bad and unchristian
      system which supports them! Allow that the man <i>was</i> a miserable
      malefactor, it was not he alone that was offended, but in his poor,
      degraded person the spirit of Justice. What did your 'authorities' do?
      They tortured the man by his love for his wife, by the memory of his
      murdered child, by all that was true and noble and divine in him. They
      crucified the Christ in that helpless man, and you stand here in the
      presence of the Vicar of Christ to excuse and defend them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "那麼，先生，願神摧毀所有這樣的政府，以及支持他們的邪惡和非基督的制度!
      即使那個男人是一個悲慘的壞蛋，並不只有他自己被冒犯，但在他貧窮，被貶低的人格中，正義的精神也受到了冒犯。你們的'當局'做了什麼？他們透過他對妻子的愛，透過他被謀殺的孩子的記憶，以及他內心所有真實，高貴和神聖的事物來折磨這個男人。他們在那個無力的人身上釘死了基督，而你站在基督的代理人面前，為他們辯護和捍衛。"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Pope had risen in his chair and lifted one hand over his head with a
      majestic gesture. Involuntarily the young King, who had been ashen pale
      for some moments, dropped to his knees, but the Baron only folded his arms
      and stiffened his legs.
    </p>
    <p>
      教皇在他的椅子上站了起來，並將一隻手豪邁地舉過頭頂。年輕國王幾剎那間臉色蒼白，不由自主地跪了下去，但男爵只是交叉雙臂，挺直雙腿。
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you ever thought, sir, of the end of the unjust Minister? Think of
      his dying hour, tortured with the memory of young lives dissolved, mothers
      dead, widows desolate, and orphans in tears. Think of the day after his
      death, when he who has passed through the world like the scourge of God
      lies at its feet, and no one so mean but he may spurn the dishonoured
      carcass. You are aiming high, your Excellency, but beware, beware!"<span

      "您是否曾經想過，先生，不公正的部長的結局？想想他臨終的時刻，被年輕生命的消失、母親的死亡、寡婦的淒慘和孤兒的眼淚的記憶所折磨。想想他死後的那一天，當他像上帝的鞭子一樣過世，整個世界都在他的腳下，沒有人比他更卑劣，但他可能會蔑視被羞辱的屍體。閣下雄心壯志，但請小心，小心！"
    </p>
    <p>The Pope sat, and the King rose to his feet.</p>
    <p>教皇坐下，國王則站起來。</p>
    <p>
      "Your Majesty," said the Pope, "the day will come when we must both
      present ourselves before God to render to Him an account of our deeds, and
      I, being far more advanced in years, will assuredly be the first. But I
      would not dare to meet the eye of my Judge if I did not this day warn you
      of the dangers in which you stand. Only God knows by what inscrutable
      decree of Providence one man is made a Pope or a King, while another man,
      his equal or superior, is made a beggar or a slave. But God who made Popes
      and Kings meant them to be the fathers, not the seducers of their
      subjects. A sovereign may be a man of good intentions, but if he is weak,
      and allows himself to fall into the hands of despotic Ministers, he is a
      worse affliction than the cruellest tyrant. Think well, your Majesty! A
      throne may be a quagmire, and a man may be buried in it, and buried
      alive."
    </p>
    <p>
      "陛下,"教宗說,
      "終有一日,我們都必須在上帝面前為我們的行為作出解釋，我年事已高，肯定會比您先到。但是如果我今日不告誡您所處的危險，我將不敢面對我的審判者。只有上帝知道為何以他深不可測的旨意，有的人成為教宗或國王，而另一些人，或許他們的素質更高，卻成為乞丐或奴隸。然而上帝創造了教宗和國王，意味著他們應該成為人民的父親，而不是誘惑者。一個君主可能有良好的打算，但如果他軟弱，讓自己落入專制的部長的手中，他比最殘酷的暴君還要可怕。深思熟慮吧，陛下！一個王位可能是一片泥潭，人可能會陷入其中，活生生地被埋葬。"
    </p>
    <p>
      The young King began to falter some incoherent words, but without
      listening the Pope rose to end the audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      年輕的國王開始含糊其詞的講起一些言不由衷的話，但不等他說完，教皇就起身結束了接見。
    </p>
    <p>
      "You promise me," said the Pope, "that if—I say <i>if</i>—in order to
      avoid bloodshed and to prevent a crime, I obtain from this lady the
      identification of her husband as the person condemned for the former
      conspiracy, you will spare and pardon him whatever happens?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "你向我承諾,"教皇說，"如果—我說如果—為了避免流血和防止犯罪，我從這個女士那裡得到她的丈夫被認定為前次陰謀的被定罪人，無論發生什麼事，你都會饒恕並寬恕他嗎?"
    </p>
    <p>"Holy Father, I give you my solemn word for it."</p>
    <p>"聖父，我向你鄭重承諾。"</p>
    <p>
      "Then leave me! Let me think!... Wait! If she consents, where must she go
      to?"
    </p>
    <p>"那就離開我！讓我思考！...等等！如果她同意，她必須去哪裡？"</p>
    <p>
      "To the Procura by the Ponte Ripetta, and, as time presses, at ten o'clock
      on Saturday morning," said the Baron.
    </p>
    <p>
      "在星期六的早上十點，走向由Ponte
      Ripetta通向的Procura，並且時間急迫，"男爵說。
    </p>
    <p>"Leave me! Leave me!"</p>
    <p>"離開我! 離開我!"</p>
    <p>
      The King knelt again and kissed the Pope's hand, but the Baron only bowed
      as he passed out behind his sovereign.
    </p>
    <p>
      "國王再次跪下來吻教皇的手，但是男爵只是在他的君主身後鞠躬行禮就離開了。"
    </p>
    <p>
      The opening of the doors let in a wave of sound that was like the roll of
      a great wind in a cave. Tenebræ had been going on for some time in the
      Basilica, and the people were singing the Miserere.
    </p>
    <p>
      當大門開啟時，一股像是在洞穴中翻滾的強風般的聲音湧了進來。黑暗禮已在大教堂中進行了一段時間，人們正在唱著懺悔詩。
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you hear him, Father?" said the Pope. "Isn't it almost enough to
      justify a man like Rossi that he has to meet a despot like that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      「父親，你有聽到他的話嗎？」教皇問。「像羅西這樣的人面對那樣的暴君，難道這還不足以證明他的正當嗎？」
    </p>
    <p>"We'll talk of it to-morrow," said the Capuchin.</p>
    <p>"我們明天再談," 那個閹狗說.</p>
    <p>
      The friar touched a bell, and the <i>palfrenieri</i> returned with the

    <p>
      Next day, being Good Friday, was passed by the Pope in religious retreat,
      which was interrupted by indispensable business only. After Mass of the
      Presanctified he sat in his study with his confessor, while his chaplain
      in black passed through on tiptoe from the private chapel, and his
      chamberlains, tired out by the ceremonies of yesterday, dozed on their
      stools in the outer hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      `次日是耶穌受難日，教皇除了不可避免的工作外，大部份時間都用在宗教的遁世之中。預祝聖禮彌撒後，他和他的告解神父在他的書房裡坐下來，而他的牧師穿著黑色的服裝，從私人禮拜堂踱步走過，而他的侍從們因為昨天的儀式累到在大廳的凳子上打瞌睡。`
    </p>
    <p>
      The day was bright but the room was darkened, and the hearts of the two
      old men were heavy. Over the face of the Pope there was a cloud of
      trouble, and the countenance of the Capuchin was solemn to the point of
      sternness. The friar sat in the old-fashioned easy-chair with his bare
      feet showing from under the edge of his brown habit; the Pope lay on the
      lounge with both hands in the vertical pockets of his white woollen
      cassock.
    </p>
    <p>
      那天雖然陽光明媚，但房間內卻昏暗無光，兩位老者的心情沉重。教皇的臉上帶著困擾的雲彩，而那個Capuchin修士的表情則嚴肅到接近嚴厲。這個修士坐在舊式的舒適椅子上，他的赤足從棕色袈裟的邊緣露出;
      教皇則躺在長榻上，雙手插在他的白色羊毛袈裟的立體口袋裡。
    </p>
    <p>"Your Holiness is not well this morning?"</p>
    <p>"您的聖潔今天早上不舒服嗎？"</p>
    <p>"Not very well, Father Pifferi."</p>
    <p>"不太好，Pifferi神父。"</p>
    <p>
      "Your Holiness was disturbed by the interview in the Sacristy. But you
      should think no more about it. In any case, what the Minister proposed was
      impossible, therefore you must dismiss it from your mind. To ask a wife to
      reveal the secrets of her husband would be tyranny worse than the rack.
      Besides, it would be uncanonical, and your Holiness could never consider
      it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "聖職者對於祭司室的訪談感到困擾。但是您不該再多想。無論如何，部長提議的事情是不可能的，因此您必須把它從您的腦海中消除。要求一位妻子揭示她丈夫的秘密比酷刑還要糟糕。此外，這是立法上不允許的，您聖職者永遠不能考慮這種事。”
    </p>
    <p>"How so?"</p>
    <p>"怎麼會這樣?"</p>
    <p>
      "Didn't your Holiness promise that whatever the nature of this poor lady's
      confidence you would hold it as sacred as the confessional?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "您的聖潔不是承諾，無論這位可憐的女士的信任是什麼性質，您都會把它視為神聖的告解嗎？"
    </p>
    <p>"Well?"</p>
    <p>"好嗎？"</p>
    <p>
      "What is the confessional, your Holiness? It is a tribunal in which the
      priest is judge and the penitent a prisoner who pleads guilty. Is the
      priest to call witnesses to prove other crimes? He has no right and no
      power to do so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "什麼是告解室，聖潔的主？告解室是一個法庭，對於此，神父是法官，懺悔者是自認有罪的囚犯。神父應該召集證人來證明其他罪行嗎？他沒有權利，也沒有力量這麼做。"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But where the penitent wittingly or unwittingly is in the position of an
      accomplice, what then, Father Pifferi?"
    </p>
    <p>"但是，當懺悔者有意無意地成為共犯的時候，那該怎麼辦，皮菲里神父？"</p>
    <p>
      "Even then it is expressly forbidden to demand the names of others upon
      the plea of preventing evil. How can you hold this lady's confidence as
      sacred and yet ask her to denounce her husband?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "即使在那種情況下，也明確禁止以防止惡行為名義要求他人的名字。你如何能尊重這位女士的信任，卻又要她告發她的丈夫?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Pope rose with a face full of pain, walked to the bookcase,<span
        class="x-ebookmaker-pageno"
        id="pgepubid00443"
        title="348"
        ><a id="Page_348" title="348"></a
      ></span>
      and took down a book. "Listen, Father," he said, and he began to read:—
    </p>
    <p>
      教皇帶著滿臉的痛苦起身，走到書櫃，取下一本書。他說：“聽我說，神父，”然後他開始閱讀：—
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i
        >If the penitent was obliged under pain of mortal sin to reveal his
        accomplices to repair a common injury, I have maintained against other
        theologians that even then the confessor cannot oblige him to do so</i
      >."
    </p>
    <p>
      "如果悔罪者在修復共同的傷害中被迫在犯重罪的痛苦下揭露他的同謀，我已經反對其他神學家主張，即使在這種情況下，告解神父也不能強迫他這樣做。"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There!" cried the Capuchin. "What did I say? Gaume is wise, and the other
      theologians, who are they?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "就在那裡!"
      那個卡布奇諾教會的修士大喊。"我說了什麼嗎？高姆是明智的，而其他的神學家，他們是誰?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Only</i>," continued the Pope, turning a page and holding up one
      finger, "<i
        >he can and must oblige him to make known his accomplices to other
        persons who can arrest the scandal</i
      >."
    </p>
    <p>
      "只有,"教宗繼續說，同時翻開一頁，並舉起一根手指，
      "他能且必須迫使他向其他人揭露他的同謀，這些人可以阻止這種醜聞。"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Capuchin took a long breath. "Is that what the Holy Father intends to
      do in this instance?"
    </p>
    <p>這位卡普奇諾修士深深地吸了一口氣。 “這是聖父打算在這種情況下做的嗎？”</p>
    <p>"He <i>can</i> and <i>must</i>."</p>
    <p>"他可以並且必須。"</p>
    <p>
      The Capuchin dropped his head, and there was a long pause, in which the
      Pope walked nervously about the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      這個加布洛修士低下了頭，接著有一段長長的沉默。在這段時間裡，教皇緊張地在房間裡走來走去。
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor child!" said the Capuchin. "But perhaps her heart has been too much
      set on human love."
    </p>
    <p>"可憐的孩子！"那個卡普其寺修士說,"但也許她的心過於依戀人間的愛情。"</p>
    <p>The Pope sighed.</p>
    <p>教皇嘆了口氣。</p>
    <p>
      "Yet who are we, whose hearts are closed to earthly affection, to
      prescribe a limit to human love?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "然而，我們這些對世俗之愛心門已經關閉的人，又有什麼資格限定人類之愛的極限呢?"
    </p>
    <p>"Who indeed?" said the Pope.</p>
    <p>"確實是誰呢？" 教宗說。</p>
    <p>"Do you recall her resemblance to any one, your Holiness?"</p>
    <p>"您的聖聖有沒有記得她跟誰相似呢?"</p>
    <p>The Pope stopped in his walk and looked towards the curtained window.</p>
    <p>教皇在他的步行中停下來，看向帷窗。</p>
    <p>
      "The same soft voice and radiant smile, the same attitude of idolatry
      towards the husband she is devoted to, the same...."
    </p>
    <p>
      "同樣柔和的聲音和燦爛的微笑，對她鍾愛的丈夫持有同樣的崇拜態度，都是一樣的...."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Sisters of the Sacred Heart will take her when all is over," said the
      Pope.
    </p>
    <p>"當一切結束時，聖心修女會將接管她，"教皇說。</p>
    <p>
      "And the man, too, whatever his errors, has a certain grandeur of soul,
      that lifts him far above these chief gaolers and detectives who call
      themselves statesmen and diplomatists, these scavengers of civilisation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "而這個人，無論他的錯誤有多少，他的靈魂有種特定的偉大，
      使他遠遠超越那些自稱為政治家和外交家的主要監獄守衛和偵探，這些文明的清道夫。"
    </p>
    <p>"He must go back to America and begin life again," said the Pope.</p>
    <p>"他必須回到美國並重新開始生活,"教皇說。</p>
    <p>
      Two hours later Father Pifferi went off to fetch Roma, and the Pope sat
      down to his mid-day meal. The room was very quiet, and in the absence of
      the church bells the city seemed to sit in silence. Cortis stood behind
      the Pope's chair, and the cat sat on a stool at the opposite side of the
      table.
    </p>
    <p>
      兩小時後，皮菲利神父走去接羅馬，教皇則坐下來吃午飯。房間非常安靜，由於教堂的鐘聲停止，整個城市似乎籠罩在寂靜之中。科提斯站在教皇的椅子後面，貓則坐在桌子對面的凳子上。

      但是這位聖潔的老人，他有宮殿但沒有家，有僕人卻沒有家庭，有軍隊卻沒有帝國，他是所有人的父親，卻不再知道人生普通的喜怒哀樂，他獨自坐在他那簡樸的小公寓中，吃他的簡單菠菜和豆子的菜。

      Good Friday's Ministerial paper announced in its official column that late
      the night before the King, attended by the Minister of the Interior, had
      paid a surprise visit to the Mint, which was in the Via Fondamenta, a lane
      approached by way of the silent passage which leads to the lodging of the
      Canons of St. Peter's. Roma was puzzling over the inexplicable
      announcement, when old John, one of Rossi's pensioners, knocked at her
      door. His face and his lips were white, and when Roma offered him money he
      put it aside impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "耶穌受難日的部長報紙在其官方欄目中宣佈，就在前一晚深夜，國王在內政部長的陪同下，對造幣廠進行了意外訪問，該廠位於Via
      Fondamenta，這是一條經由通往聖彼得大教堂教士住所的寂靜通道進入的巷道。當羅馬為這難以解釋的公告感到困惑時，羅西的一位年邁的養老金接受者約翰敲了她的門。他的臉和嘴唇都是白色的，當羅馬給他錢時，他不耐煩地將其推開。"

      "You mustn't think a gold hammer can break the gate of heaven,
      Eccellenza," the old man said.
    </p>
    <p>"您不能認為一把金錘可以打破天堂的大門，尊貴的先生，" 老人說。</p>
    <p>
      Then he told his story. The King had seen the Pope in secret the night
      before, and there was something going on about the Honourable Rossi. John
      knew it because his grandson had left Rome that morning for Chiasso, and
      another member of the secret police had started for Modane. If Donna Roma
      knew where the Honourable was to be found, she had better tell him not to
      return to Italy.
    </p>
    <p>
      然後他講述了他的故事。國王在前一個晚上秘密見了教皇，並對羅西榮譽賦予了某種安排。約翰知道這一點，因為他的孫子在那天早上就離開了羅馬前往基亞索，另一名秘密警察則出發前往莫丹。如果多納羅馬知道榮譽的位置，那麼她最好告訴他不要回到義大利。
    </p>
    <p>
      "Better be a wood-bird than a cage-bird, you know," the old man whispered.
    </p>
    <p>"你知道，當一隻森林鳥總比當一隻籠子裡的鳥要好，"老人低聲道。</p>
    <p>
      Roma thanked him for his news, and then warned him of the risk he ran,
      being dependent on his grandson and his grandson's wife.
    </p>
    <p>"羅馬感謝他的消息，然後警告他依賴他的孫子和孫子的妻子所帶來的風險。"</p>
    <p>"That's nothing," he said, "nothing at all <i>now</i>."</p>
    <p>"那沒什麼,"他說，“現在完全沒什麼。”</p>
    <p>
      Last night he had dreamed a dream. He thought he was a strong man again,
      with his children about him, and beholden to no one. How happy he had
      been! But when he awoke, and found it was not true, and that he was old
      and feeble, he felt that he could hear it no longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "昨晥他做了個夢。他夢想他又變成了一個強壯的男人，
      他的孩子們在他身邊，並且不再需要依賴任何人。他是多麼的快樂！
      但是當他醒來，發現這不是真的，他已經老了，變得虛弱，
      他覺得他再也無法忍受這種痛苦了。"

      it can't last long, Eccellenza," he said in a tremulous voice, smiling
      with his toothless mouth, and nodding slightly as he went away.
    </p>
    <p>
      "我在這裡也擋了路，又吃了小孩子們的飯，所以不能繼續下去，閣下，"他用微微震抖的聲音說，嘴裡沒有牙齒的他露出微笑，然後點點頭，慢慢地離開了。

      In the uneasy depths of Roma's soul only one thing was now certain. Her
      husband was in danger, and he must not attempt to cross the frontier. Yet
      how was he to be prevented? The difficulty was enormous. If only Rossi had
      replied to her letter by telegram, as she had asked him to do, she might
      have found some means of communication. At length an idea occurred to her,
      and she sat down to write a letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      在羅馬的內心深處，現在只有一件事是確定的。她的丈夫處於危險之中，他絕不能試圖越過邊境。但是，該如何阻止他呢？這個困難重大。如果羅西能像她要求的那樣回覆她的信件，她可能會找到一些交流的方法。終於，她想到了一個主意，坐下來寫一封信。
    </p>
    <p style="padding-top: 0.5em">
      "Dearest," she wrote, while her eyes shone with a kind of delirium and
      tears trickled down her cheeks, "I am very ill, and as you cannot come to
      me I must go to you. Don't think me too weak and womanish, after all my
      solemn promises to be so strong and brave. But I can only live by love,
      dearest, and your absence is more than I can bear. You will think I ought
      to be content with your letters, and certainly they have been very sweet
      and dear to me; but they are so few, and they come at such long intervals,
      and now they seem to have stopped altogether. Perhaps at the bottom of my
      selfish heart, too, I think your letters might be a wee bit more
      lover-like, but then men don't write real love letters, and nearly every
      woman would confess, if she told the truth, and she is a little
      disappointed in that regard.
    </p>
    <p style="padding-top: 0.5em">
      "親愛的，"她寫道，同時她的眼睛因一種狂熱閃爍，淚水順著她的臉頰
      trickle下來，"我病得很重，因為你不能來我這裡，所以我必須去找你。不要把我看得太脆弱和女人氣，畢竟我曾鄭重承諾要變得堅強和勇敢。但我只能靠愛過活，親愛的，你的缺席讓我難以忍受。你可能會覺得我應該滿足你的信件，當然，這些信對我來說是甜蜜和親愛的，但是這些信實在太少，而且間隔時間太長，現在似乎完全停止了。也許，在我自私的心底，我認為你的信可能可能會有些像愛戀者那樣，但是男人們不寫真實的愛情信，幾乎所有的女人會承認，如果她說出了事實，她在這方面會有些失落。"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know my husband has other things to think about, great things, high and
      noble aims and objects, but I am only a woman in spite of my loud
      pretences, and I must be loved, or I shall die. Not that I am afraid of
      dying, because I know that if I die I shall be with you in a moment, and
      this cruel separation will be at an end. But I want to live, and I'm
      certain I shall begin to feel better after I have passed a few moments at
      your side. So I shall pack up immediately and start away on the wings of
      the morning.

    <p>
      "我知道我的丈夫有其他事情要考慮，偉大的事物，崇高和貴族的目標和目的，但我只是一個女人，盡管我大聲地假裝，我必須被愛，否則我會死。不是我害怕死，因為我知道如果我死，我將立刻和你在一起，這種殘忍的分離將會結束。但我想活下去，我確定在我在你身邊過了一些時間後，我將開始覺得好些。所以我將立刻打包並乘著早晨的翅膀出發。"

      when so many things are happening; but you will put it aside for a little
      while, won't you, and take me up into the Alps somewhere, and nurse me
      back to health and happiness? Fancy! We shall be boy and girl again, as in

      在這些周裡，我所生活的世界沒有陽光，我怎麼可能會是其他樣子呢？我知道你的工作非常緊張，尤其是現在，當許多事情正在發生；但你會暫時放下它，帶我到阿爾卑斯山的某個地方，讓我恢復健康和幸福吧？想象一下！我們將再次成為男孩和女孩，像那些日子裡，你曾經為我捉蝴蝶，然後在我像個頑皮的孩子把它們弄皺時你變得悲傷。"
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Au revoir</i>, dearest. I shall fall into your hands nearly as soon as
      this letter. I tremble to think you may be angry with me for following you
      and interrupting your work. If you show it in your face I shall certainly
      expire. But you will be good to your poor pilgrim of love and comfort and
      strengthen her. All the time you have been away she has never forgotten
      you for a moment—no, not one waking moment. An ordinary woman who loved an
      ordinary man would not tell him this, but you are not ordinary, and if I
      am I don't care a pin to pretend.

      “再見，我最親愛的。我將在你收到這封信不久後落入你的手中。我害怕你會因為我跟蹤你、打擾你的工作而生氣。如果你的臉上表現出來，我肯定會死去。但你會對你的愛情朝聖者好，給予她慰藉和力量。在你離開的這段時間裡，她沒有一個清醒的瞬間忘記過你——不，沒有一刻。一個愛一個普通男人的普通女人不會告訴他這些，但你不是普通的，如果我是普通的，我無所謂假裝。”

      The strain of this letter, with its conscious subterfuge and its
      unconscious truth, put Roma into a state of fever; and when she had
      finished it and sent it to the post, her head was light, and she was aware
      for the first time that she was really ill.
    </p>
    <p>
      這封信的壓力，其中明顯的偽裝和不自覺的真實，使羅馬進入一種發熱的狀態；當她寫完它並將其寄到郵局時，她的頭輕飄飄的，並且她首次體驗到她真正的病態。

      The Garibaldian had come upstairs smiling and winking, and holding out a
      letter. "From Trinità de' Monti," he whispered. Flushing crimson and
      trembling visibly, Roma took the letter out of the old man's hands with as
      much apprehension as if he had tried to deal her a blow, and went off to
      her room.

      She knelt and kissed his ring. He raised her and put her to sit on the
      lounge, sitting in the arm-chair himself, and continuing to hold her hand.
      The Capuchin stood by the window, holding the curtain aside as if looking
      out on the piazza.
    </p>
    <p>
      她跪下吻了他的戒指。他抬起她，讓她坐在沙發上，自己坐在扶手椅上，並繼續握著她的手。那位卡布奇諾修道士站在窗邊，像是在凝視著廣場一樣把窗簾拉到一邊。
    </p>
    <p>
      "You believe the Holy Father would not send for you to injure you?" he
      said.
    </p>
    <p>"你相信聖父不會叫你來傷害你嗎？"他說。</p>
    <p>"I am sure he would not, your Holiness," she answered.</p>
    <p>"我確信他不會的，陛下，"她回答。</p>
    <p>
      "And though I disapprove of your husband's doings, you know I would not
      willingly do him any harm?"
    </p>
    <p>"即使我不同意你丈夫的所作所為，你知道我不會有意傷害他，對吧？"</p>
    <p>
      "The Holy Father would not do harm to any one; and my husband is so good,
      and his aims are so noble, that nobody who really knew him could ever try
      to injure him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "教宗絕對不會傷害任何人；我的丈夫如此善良，他的目標如此高尚，認識他的人都絕不會試圖傷害他。"
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked into her face; it shone with a frightened joy, and pity grew
      upon him.
    </p>
    <p>他看著她的臉；它散發出恐慌喜悅的光芒，使他感到愈來愈憐憫。</p>
    <p>
      "Your devotion to your husband is very sweet and beautiful, my daughter,
      and it grieves the Holy Father's heart to trouble it. But it seems to be
      his duty to do so, and he must do his duty."
    </p>
    <p>
      "你對丈夫的忠誠非常甜蜜和美麗，我的女兒，這讓聖父的心感到痛苦。但似乎他有責任去煩擾它，他必須履行他的責任。"
    </p>
    <p>
      Again she looked up timidly, and again the sense came to him of dumb eyes
      full of entreaty.
    </p>
    <p>`她再次羞怯地抬起頭，他再次感覺到那雙無聲的眼睛充滿了乞求。`</p>
    <p>
      "My daughter, your husband's motives may not be bad. They may even be good
      and noble. It is often so with men of his sympathies. They see the
      disparity of wealth and poverty, and their hearts are torn with anger and
      with pity. But, my child, they do not know that true and lasting reforms,
      such as affect the whole human family, can only be<span

      accomplished by God and by the authority of His Holy Church and
      Pontificate, and that it must be the bell of St. Peter's which announces
      them to the world."
    </p>
    <p>
      "我的女兒，你的丈夫的動機可能並不壞。他們甚至可能是良好和高尚的。對於有他同情心的男人來說，這常常是這樣的。他們看到財富和貧窮的懸殊，他們的心被憤怒和憐憫撕裂。但是，我的孩子，他們不知道真正且持久的改革，如影響整個人類家庭的那種，只能由上帝和他的聖教會和教皇的權力來完成，而且必須是聖彼得教堂的鐘聲向世界宣告這些改革。"
    </p>
    <p>
      As the Pope was speaking the colour ran up Roma's face like a flag of
      distress. She looked helplessly round at the Capuchin. The dumb eyes
      seemed to ask when the blow would fall.
    </p>
    <p>
      `當教皇說話時，羅馬的臉色猶如遇到困境的旗幟一樣變得潮紅。她無奈地看著卡普奇諾，那無聲的眼神彷彿在問何時會遭受打擊。`
    </p>
    <p>
      "As a consequence, what is he doing, my daughter? Ignoring the Church,
      which like a true mother is ever anxious to bear the burden of human
      weakness and suffering; he is setting up a new gospel, such as would
      reduce mankind to a worse barbarism than that from which Christ freed us.
      Is this conduct worthy of your devotion, my child?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "所以，他在做什麼，我的女兒？他無視教會，就像真正的母親一直都在渴望承擔人類的弱點和苦難；他正在創設一種新的福音，這樣會使人類陷入比基督解放我們的野蠻更糟的狀況。你真的認為這種行為值得你的崇敬，我的孩子嗎？"
    </p>
    <p>Roma fixed her timid eyes on the Pope's face and answered:</p>
    <p>"羅馬將她羞怯的眼神定在教皇的臉上，並回答說："</p>
    <p>
      "I have nothing to do with my husband's opinions, your Holiness. I have
      only to be true to the friendship he gives me and the love I bear him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "對於我丈夫的觀點，我無可奈何，聖父。我只需要真實地對待他對我所給予的友誼，以及我對他的愛。"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My child," said the Pope, "ask yourself what your husband is doing at
      this moment. Not content with sowing the seeds of discord in Parliament
      and by the press, he is wandering through Europe, gathering up the
      adventurers who work in darkness in every country, and hatching a
      conspiracy which would lead to a state of anarchy throughout the world."
    </p>
    <p>
      "我的孩子，"教皇說，"問自己你的丈夫此刻在做什麼。他不僅在議會和新聞界播下不和的種子，還在整個歐洲四處徘徊，收集每個國家暗中活動的冒險家，並策劃一場將導致全世界陷入無政府狀態的陰謀。"
    </p>
    <p>
      Roma withdrew her hand from the hand of the Pope and made an exclamation
      of dissent.
    </p>
    <p>"羅馬從教皇的手中抽出自己的手，並發出反對的驚嘆。"</p>
    <p>
      "Ah, I know what you would say, my daughter. He did not set out to produce
      anarchy. Such men never do. They begin with evolution and end with
      revolution. They begin with peace and end with violence. And the only
      sequel to your husband's aims must be the destruction of civil society, of
      Government, and of the Church."
    </p>
    <p>
      "啊，我知道你想說什麼，我的女兒。他並沒有打算製造無政府狀態。這類人從來不會。他們先開始進行進化，最後導致革命。他們以和平開始，以暴力結束。並且你丈夫的目標唯一可能的後續就是破壞公民社會，政府和教會。"
    </p>
    <p>
      Roma's fingers were clasped convulsively in her lap. She lifted her timid
      but passionate face and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "羅馬的指尖緊緊地交疊在她的膝蓋上。她抬起了她羞怯但充滿激情的臉並說："
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know nothing about that, your Holiness. I only know that whatever he is
      doing his heart laid it upon him as a duty, and his heart is pure and
      noble."
    </p>
    <p>
      "我對此一無所知，聖父。我只知道無論他在做什麼，他的心認為那是他的義務，而他的心靈是純潔和高貴的。"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My daughter, your husband may be the greatest of patriots in spirit and
      intention, but nevertheless he is one of the criminal and visionary
      teachers of this unhappy time who are deluding the ignorant crowd with
      promises that can never be realised. Anarchy, chaos, the uprooting of
      religion<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00454" title="356"

      and morality, of justice, human dignity, and the purity of domestic
      life—these are the only possible fruits of the seed he is sowing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "女兒，你的丈夫可能在精神和意圖上是最偉大的愛國者，但他仍然是這個充滿痛苦的時代中，用無法實現的承諾迷惑無知群眾的犯罪和空想的教師之一。無政府狀態，混亂，宗教和道德的顛覆，正義，人類尊嚴和家庭生活的純潔—這些都是他撒下的種子的唯一可能的果實。"
    </p>
    <p>
      The timid eyes began to flash. "I did not come here to hear this, your
      Holiness." The Pope put his hand tenderly on her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "羞怯的眼睛開始閃爍。“我並不是為了聽這個來的，神聖的。”教皇溫柔地將手放在她的手上。"
    </p>
    <p>"Remember, my child, what you said yourself on your former visit."</p>
    <p>"請記住，我兒，你在上次拜訪時自己說過的話。"</p>
    <p>Roma dropped her head.</p>
    <p>羅馬低下了她的頭。</p>
    <p>"The authorities know all about it."</p>
    <p>"當局已全部知道。"</p>
    <p>"Holy Father!"</p>
    <p>"教宗聖父!"</p>
    <p>"It was necessary."</p>
    <p>"這是必要的。"</p>
    <p>"Then ... then somebody must have told them."</p>
    <p>"那麼...那麼肯定有人告訴他們。"</p>
    <p>
      "I told them. The Holy Father revealed no more than was necessary to
      relieve his conscience and to prevent crime. It was your own tongue that
      told the rest, my daughter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "我已告訴他們。聖父不會透露超過足以舒緩他的良心並防止犯罪的事情。是你自己的舌頭把其餘的事告訴了出來，我的女兒。"
    </p>
    <p>
      He recalled what had passed in the cabinet of the Prime Minister, and Roma
      felt as if something choked her. "No matter!" she said, with the same
      frightened but passionate face. "David Rossi is prepared for anything, and
      he will be prepared for this."
    </p>
    <p>
      他回想起在首相的辦公室裡發生的事情，羅馬覺得像是有什麼東西讓她感到窒息。"不要緊！"
      她以相同的驚恐但充滿熱情的面孔說道。
      "大衛·羅西已經準備好了任何事情，他將為此做好準備。"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The authorities already knew more than I could tell them," said the Pope.
      "They knew where your husband was and what he was doing. They know where
      he is now, and they are preparing to arrest him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "當局已經知道的比我能告訴他們的還要多，"教皇說。
      "他們知道你的丈夫在哪裡，他在做什麼。他們知道他現在在哪裡，並且正在準備逮捕他。"
    </p>
    <p>
      Roma's nerves grew more and more excited, the timid look gave place to a
      look of defiance.
    </p>
    <p>"羅馬的神經越來越緊張，原本膽怯的眼神已換成了挑戰的眼神。"</p>
    <p>"They tell me that he is in Berlin at this moment. Is it true?"</p>
    <p>"他們告訴我他現在正在柏林。是真的嗎？"</p>
    <p>Roma did not reply.</p>
    <p>羅馬沒有回答。</p>
    <p>
      "They say their advices from official sources leave no doubt that he is
      engaged in conspiracy."
    </p>
    <p>"他們說，他們從官方來源得到的建議無疑證明他正在參與陰謀。"</p>
    <p>Still Roma did not reply.</p>
    <p>然而，羅馬仍然沒有回答。</p>
    <p>
      "They say confidently that the conspiracy points to rebellion, and is
      intended to include regicide. Is it so?"
    </p>
    <p>"他們自信地說，陰謀指向叛亂，並且打算涵蓋弒君。是這樣嗎？"</p>
    <p>Roma bit her lip and remained silent.</p>
    <p>"羅馬咬住她的唇，保持沉默。"</p>
    <p>
      "Can't you trust me, my child? Don't you know the Holy Father? Only give
      me some hope that these statements are untrue, and the Holy Father is
      ready to withstand all evil influences against you, and face the world in
      your defence."
    </p>
    <p>
      "你難道不能相信我，我的孩子嗎？你不認識聖父嗎？只要你給我一點希望，這些語言是不真實的，聖父就準備好抵擋所有對你的邪惡影響，並在你的防禦中面對世界。"
    </p>
    <p>
      Roma felt as if something would snap within her brain. "I cannot say ... I
      do not know," she faltered.<span

    </p>
    <p>"羅馬覺得她的大腦似乎要撕裂。“我不能說...我不知道，”她口吃地說。</p>
    <p>
      "But have you any uncertainty, my daughter? If you have the least reason
      to believe that these statements are slanders of malicious imaginations,
      tell me so, and I will give your husband the benefit of the doubt."
    </p>
    <p>
      "但是，我的女兒，你有沒有任何疑慮？如果你有最少的理由認為這些說法是惡意想像的誹謗，告訴我，我將給你的丈夫一個懷疑的利益。"
    </p>
    <p>
      Roma rose to her feet, but she held on to the edge of the table that stood
      by her side, rigid, quivering, frail and silent. The Pope looked up at her
      with weary eyes, and continued in a caressing tone:
    </p>
    <p>
      "羅馬站了起來，但她緊緊抓著身邊桌子的邊緣，僵硬，顫抖，虛弱而無聲。教皇用疲倦的眼神看著她，並以撫慰的語氣繼續說道："
    </p>
    <p>
      "If unhappily you have no doubt that your husband is engaged in dangerous
      enterprises, can you not dissuade him from them?"
    </p>
    <p>"如果你不幸的確認你的丈夫正在參與危險的事業，你不能勸阻他嗎？"</p>
    <p>
      "No," said Roma, struggling with her tears, "that is impossible. Whether
      he is right or wrong, it is not for me to sit in judgment upon him.
      Besides, long ago, before we were married, I promised that I would never
      stand between him and his work, and I never can—never."
    </p>
    <p>
      "不，"羅馬哭著說，"那是不可能的。無論他是對還是錯，我都不能對他進行審判。此外，很久以前，我們結婚之前，我就答應過我永遠不會阻撓他和他的工作，我永遠不能---絕對不能。"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But if he loves you, my child, would he not wish for your sake to avoid
      the danger?"
    </p>
    <p>"但如果他真的愛你，我的孩子，那他不是應該為了你，避免這種危險嗎？"</p>
    <p>
      "I can't ask him. I told him to go on without thinking of me, and I would
      take care of myself whatever happened."
    </p>
    <p>
      "我不能問他。我告訴他不用考慮我，繼續做他自己的事，無論發生什麼我都能自己照顧自己。"
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes were now shining with her tears. The Pope patted the hand on the
      table.
    </p>
    <p>`她的眼睛現在因為眼淚而閃亮。教宗輕輕拍了一下放在桌子上的手。`</p>
    <p>
      "Can you not at least go to him and warn him, and thus leave him to judge
      for himself, my daughter?"
    </p>
    <p>"你不能至少去找他，警告他，然後讓他自己判斷嗎，我的女兒？"</p>
    <p>"Yes ... no, that is impossible also."</p>
    <p>"是的……不，那也是不可能的。"</p>
    <p>"Why so, my child?"</p>
    <p>"為什麼，我的孩子？"</p>
    <p>
      "Because I don't know where he is, and I shouldn't know where to find him.
      In his last letter he said it was better I should not know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "因為我不知道他在哪裡，我也不應該知道去哪裡找他。他在最後一封信中說，最好我不知道。"
    </p>
    <p>"Then he has cut himself off from you entirely?"</p>
    <p>"那麼他已經完全與你斷絕聯絡了嗎？"</p>
    <p>"Entirely. I am to see him next in Rome."</p>
    <p>"完全如此。我下次將在羅馬見到他。"</p>
    <p>
      "And meantime, that he may not run the risk of being traced by his
      enemies, he has stopped all channels of communication with his friends?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "而與此同時，為了避免被敵人追蹤，他已經停止了與朋友們的所有聯絡通道嗎？"
    </p>
    <p>"Yes."</p>
    <p>"是的。"</p>
    <p>
      The Pope's face whitened visibly, and an inward voice said to him, "This
      is God's hand. Death is waiting for the man in Rome, and he is walking
      blindly on to it."
    </p>
    <p>
      教皇的臉色顯然變得蒼白，一種內心的聲音對他說：“這是神的手。死亡正在等待羅馬的那個男人，他正盲目地走向它。”
    </p>
    <p>
      The weary eyes looked with compassion on Roma's quivering face. "There's
      no help for it," thought the Pope.
    </p>
    <p>
      那雙疲態的眼睛憐憫地看著羅馬的臉龐在顫抖。“無計可施了，” 教宗思緒萬千。
    </p>
    <p>
      "Suppose, my child ... suppose it were within your power to hinder evil
      consequences, would you do it?"<span

    <p>"我是一個女人，教宗父。一個女人能阻止什麼事情呢?"</p>
    <p>
      "In the history of nations it has sometimes happened that a woman has been
      able to save life and protect society by raising a little hand like this."
    </p>
    <p>
      "在國家的歷史中，有時候一個女人能夠僅僅抬起一隻小手就能保護社會並拯救生命。"
    </p>
    <p>The Pope lifted Roma's quivering fingers from the table.</p>
    <p>教宗將羅馬顫抖的手指從桌子上抬起。</p>
    <p>
      "If there is anything I can do, your Holiness, without breaking my promise
      or betraying my husband...."
    </p>
    <p>"如果有任何我能做的事，聖潔的，而不會背叛我夫人的承諾...."</p>

    <p>"無論如何！如果可以拯救我的丈夫... 您告訴我，您的聖善。"</p>
    <p>
      He told her the proposal of the Prime Minister and the promise of the
      King. His voice vibrated. He was like a man who was wounding himself at
      every word. She looked at him until he had finished, without ability to
      speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      他告訴她首相的提議和國王的承諾。他的聲音在震動。他就像一個每說一個字就在傷害自己的人。她看著他，直到他說完，無法說話。
    </p>
    <p>"You ask me to <i>denounce</i> my husband?"</p>
    <p>"你要我譴責我的丈夫嗎？"</p>
    <p>"It is the only way to save him, my daughter."</p>
    <p>"這是唯一可以拯救他的方法，我的女兒。"</p>
    <p>
      She looked round the room with helpless eyes, full of a dumb appeal for
      mercy or the chance of escape.
    </p>
    <p>她無助地環顧房間，眼中充滿了無聲的哀求，渴望著憐憫或逃脫的機會。</p>
    <p>
      "Holy Father," she said in a choking voice, "that is what his enemies have
      been asking me to do all this time, and because I have refused they have
      persecuted me with poverty and shame. And now that I come to you for
      refuge and shelter, thinking your fatherly arms will protect me, you ...
      even you...."
    </p>
    <p>
      "聖父，"她聲音哽咽地說，"這就是他的敵人一直要求我做的事，就因為我拒絕了，他們用貧困和恥辱迫害我。現在當我來尋求您的庇護和避風港，希望您能像父親一樣的雙臂保護我時，您...就連您…"
    </p>
    <p>
      She broke off as by a sudden thought, and said: "But it is impossible. He
      is my husband, therefore I cannot witness against him."
    </p>
    <p>
      她突然想到什麼似的停下來，然後說：“但這是不可能的。他是我的丈夫，所以我不能作為證人對他作證。”
    </p>
    <p>
      "My heart bleeds for you, my child, and I am ashamed to gainsay you. But
      an oath is not necessary to a denunciation, and if it were so the law of
      this unchristian country would not recognise you as Rossi's wife."
    </p>
    <p>
      "我的心為你流血，我的孩子，我很羞愧否認你。但是，誓言對於譴責並不是必要的，即使是這樣，這個非基督教國家的法律也不會承認你是羅西的妻子。"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But he will know who has denounced him. I am the only one in the world to
      whom he has told his secrets, and he will hate me and part from me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "但他會知道是誰出賣了他。我是世界上唯一一個他向我坦白秘密的人，他會恨我，並離我而去。"

    <p>"You will have saved his life, my daughter."</p>
    <p>"你將會拯救他的生命，我的女兒。"</p>
    <p>
      "What is it to me to have saved his life if he is lost to me for ever?"
    </p>
    <p>"如果他永遠地從我身邊消失，那麼救他的生命對我有什麼意義呢?"</p>
    <p>
      "Is it you that say that, my child—you that have sacrificed so much
      already? Doesn't the highest love remember first the welfare of the loved

      "無論如何，他的事業都將毀滅。它已經註定了。而當他的夢幻般的計劃化為灰塵，當一切都成為失敗和虛無，當你的淚水無法恢復過去時...."
    </p>
    <p>"But he will be banished, and I shall never see him again."</p>
    <p>"但他將被放逐，我再也見不到他了。"</p>
    <p>
      "It will be the less of two evils, my child," said the Pope. And in the
      solemn, vibrating voice that rang in Roma's ears like the voice of Rossi,
      he added, "'Whosoever sheds man's blood by man shall his blood be shed.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "這會是兩害中的輕者，我的孩子，"教皇說。他以那
      ple果體的、振動的聲音對羅馬說，像羅西的聲音一樣在她的耳朵裡迴響，他補充說，"'凡流人血的，他的血也必被人所流。'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Roma held on to the table, feeling at every moment as if she might
      fall with a crash.
    </p>
    <p>"羅馬再次緊緊抓住桌子，感覺每一刻都像是她可能會摔倒一樣。"</p>
    <p>
      "That's what would come to your husband if he were arrested and condemned
      for a conspiracy to kill the King. And even if the humane spirit of the
      age snatched him from death—what then? A cell in a prison on a volcanic
      rock in the sea, a stone sepulchre for the living dead, buried like a toad
      in a hole left by the running lava of life, guarded, watched, tortured in
      body and soul—a figure of tremendous tragedy, the hapless man once
      worshipped by the people spreading impotent hands to the outer world,
      until madness comes to his relief and suicide helps him to escape into
      eternity and leave only his wasted body on the earth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "如果你的丈夫因策劃謀殺國王而被捕並定罪，那將是他的命運。即使是這個時代的人道精神將他從死亡邊緣贖回，那又如何呢？海上一個火山石頭上的監獄中的一個囚室，對於生者來說就像是一個石棺，像一隻蟾蜍被活埋在生命熔岩的洞裡，被看管，被監視，身體和靈魂都受到折磨——一個悲壯的形象，曾經被人們所崇拜的人無助地伸出手向外界，直到瘋狂來到他的救贖，自殺幫助他逃逸到永恆的世界，只留下他在地球上被浪費的身體。"
    </p>
    <p>
      Roma could bear the nervous tension no longer. "I'll do it," she said.
    </p>
    <p>"羅馬再也無法承受這種緊張的壓力了。"我來做,"她說。"</p>
    <p>
      "My brave child!" said the Capuchin, turning from the window, with a face
      broken up by emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "我的勇敢的孩子！"那位卡普奇僧人轉過身來，離開窗戶，面容因為情緒的激動而變得扭曲。
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is one thing to repeat a secret if it is to harm any one, and quite
      another thing if it is to do good, isn't it?" said Roma.
    </p>
    <p>
      "如果揭示一個秘密是為了傷害某人，那就是一回事，但如果是為了做好事，那就完全是另一回事，不是嗎？"羅馬說。
    </p>
    <p>"Indeed it is," said the Capuchin.</p>
    <p>"確實如此," 那卡普奇諾說。</p>
    <p>
      "He will never forgive me—I know that quite well. He will never imagine I
      would have died rather than do it. But I shall know I have done it for the
      best."
    </p>
    <p>
      "他永遠不會原諒我——我非常明白這一點。他永遠不會想像到我寧願死也不會去做那件事。但是我知道，我是為了最好的結果而做的。"
    </p>
    <p>"Indeed you will."</p>
    <p>"的確，你會的。"</p>
    <p>
      Roma's eyes were shining with fresh tears, and she was struggling to keep
      back her sobs. "When we parted on the night he went away he said perhaps
      we were parting for ever. I promised to be faithful to death itself, but I
      was thinking of my own death, not his, and I didn't imagine that to save
      his life I must betray his...."<span

      "羅馬的眼睛閃爍著新的淚光，她努力抑制自己的哭泣。'當我們在他離開的那個夜晚分開時，他說我們也許要永遠分開。我承諾將對他忠誠到死，但我想的是自己的死亡，而不是他的，我無法想象為了救他的生命，我必須背叛他....'"
    </p>
    <p>
      But at that moment she broke down utterly, and the Pope, who had returned
      to his seat, rose again to comfort her.
    </p>
    <p>"但就在那一刻，她完全崩潰了，而已經回到座位的教皇再次站起來安慰她。"</p>
    <p>
      "Calm yourself, my daughter," he said. "What you are going to do is an act
      of heroic self-sacrifice. Be brave and Heaven will reward you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "鎮靜下來，我的女兒，"他說。"你將要做的是一種英勇的自我犧牲。勇敢一些，天堂將會報答你。"
    </p>
    <p>
      She grew calmer after a while, and then Father Pifferi made arrangements
      for the visit to the Procura. He would call for her at ten in the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      `過了一會兒，她變得更加冷靜，然後皮弗裡神父安排了去普羅庫拉的訪問。他將在早上十點來接她。`
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wait!" said Roma. A new light had come into her face—the light of a new
      idea.
    </p>
    <p>"等一下！" 羅馬說。她的臉上浮現出新的光芒——一個新想法的光芒。</p>
    <p>"What is it, my daughter?" said the Pope.</p>
    <p>"你有什麼事，我的女兒?" 是教宗說的。</p>
    <p>
      "Holy Father, there is something I had forgotten. But I must tell you
      before it is too late. It may alter your view of everything. When you hear
      it you may say, 'You must not speak a word. You shall not speak. It is
      impossible.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "聖父，有件事我之前忘了說。但我必須在為時已晚之前告訴你。這可能會改變你對所有事情的看法。當你聽到它時，你可能會說，'你不可以說出來。你不能說出來。這是不可能的。'"
    </p>
    <p>"Tell me, my child."</p>
    <p>"告訴我，我的孩子。"</p>
    <p>
      Roma hesitated and looked from the Capuchin to the Pope. "How can I tell
      you," she said. "It is so difficult. I hadn't meant to tell any one."
    </p>
    <p>
      羅馬猶豫了一下，從卡普奇諾大道看向教皇。「我該如何跟你說這件事，」她說道。「這太困難了。原本我並沒有打算告訴任何人。」
    </p>
    <p>"Go on, my daughter."</p>
    <p>"繼續，我的女兒。"</p>
    <p>"My husband's name...."</p>
    <p>"我丈夫的名字...."</p>
    <p>"Well?"</p>
    <p>"好嗎？"</p>
    <p>
      "Rossi is not really his name, your Holiness. It is the name he took on
      returning to Italy, because the one he had borne abroad had been involved
      in trouble."
    </p>
    <p>
      "羅西其實並非他的真名，聖父。這是他回到義大利時所取的名字，因為他在國外所使用的名字已經被捲入了麻煩中。"
    </p>
    <p>"Just so," said the Pope.</p>
    <p>"正是如此,"教皇說。</p>
    <p>"Holy Father, David Rossi was a friendless orphan."</p>
    <p>"聖父，大衛·羅西是一個無朋友的孤兒。"</p>
    <p>"I have heard so," said the Pope.</p>
    <p>"我已經聽說過了，"教皇說。</p>
    <p>
      "He never knew his father—not even by name. His mother was a poor unhappy
      woman who had been cruelly deceived by everybody. She drowned herself in
      the Tiber."
    </p>
    <p>
      "他從未認識過他的父親，甚至連名字都不知道。他的母親是一個窮困悲慘的女人，被每個人都殘酷地欺騙。她在台伯河中溺死了自己。"
    </p>
    <p>"Poor soul," said the Pope.</p>
    <p>"可憐的靈魂," 教皇說。</p>
    <p>
      "He was nursed in the Foundling, your Holiness, and brought up in a straw
      hut in the Campagna, and then sold as a boy into England."
    </p>
    <p>
      "他在孤兒院長大，教宗閣下，在坎帕尼亞的稻草屋中度過童年，然後作為一個男孩被賣到英格蘭。"
    </p>
    <p>The Pope moved uneasily in his seat.</p>
    <p>教皇在座位上不安地移動。</p>
    <p>
      "My father found him on the streets of London on a winter's night, your
      Holiness, carrying a squirrel and an accordion. He wore a ragged suit of
      velveteens which used to be laughed at by the London boys, and that was
      all that sheltered his little body from the cold. 'Some poor man's child,'
      my father thought. But who can say if it was so, your Holiness?"<span

      "我的父親在倫敦的街頭，在一個冬夜發現了他，你的神聖，他攜帶著一隻松鼠和一把手風琴。他身著破舊的天鵝絨禮服，這使他成為倫敦男孩的笑柄，只有這樣才能保護他的小身體免於寒冷。'某個窮人的孩子，'我的父親這麼想。但誰能說這是真的，你的神聖?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Pope was silent. A sudden change had come over his face. Roma's eyes
      were held down, her voice was agitated, she was scarcely able to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      教宗沉默了。他的面容突然顯現出變化。羅馬的眼睛垂下，她的聲音充滿激動，幾乎無法說話。
    </p>
    <p>
      "My father was angry with the boy's father, I remember, and if at that
      time he had known where to find him I think he would have denounced him to
      the public or even the police."
    </p>
    <p>
      "我記得，我父親對那個男孩的父親非常生氣，如果那時他知道如何找到他，我想他可能會向公眾甚至警察揭發他。"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Pope's head sank on his breast; the Capuchin looked steadfastly at
      Roma.
    </p>
    <p>"教皇的頭垂在他的胸前; Capuchin堅定地看著羅馬。"</p>
    <p>
      "But who knows if he was really to blame, your Holiness? He may have been
      a good man after all—one of those who have to suffer all their lives for
      the sins of others. Perhaps ... perhaps that very night he was walking the
      streets of London, looking in vain among its waifs and outcasts for the
      little lost boy who owned his own blood and bore his name."
    </p>
    <p>
      "但是，誰知道他是否真的該受到責備，聖父？他可能一直是個好人——其中一種必須終其一生為其他人的罪行受苦的人。也許...也許那個晚上，他正在倫敦的街頭走動，無望地在其流浪者和被社會遺棄者之間尋找那個失散的小男孩，他擁有自己的血，並且帶著他的名字。"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Pope's face was white and quivering. His elbows rested on the arms of
      his chair and his wrinkled hands were tightly clasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      教皇的臉色蒼白且顫抖。他的手肘支撐在椅子的扶手上，他皺紋深刻的雙手緊緊地交錯在一起。
    </p>
    <p>
      Roma stopped. There was a prolonged silence. The atmosphere of the room
      seemed to be whirling round with frightful rapidity to one terrific focus.
    </p>
    <p>
      "羅馬停了下來。接著是一段持久的沉默。室內的氛圍似乎正在恐怖地快速旋轉，凝聚為一個驚人的焦點。"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Holy Father," said Roma at length, in a low tone, "if David Rossi were
      <i>your own son</i>, would you still ask me to denounce him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "羅馬神父,"
      羅馬終於用低聲說,"如果大衛·羅西是你的親生兒子,你還會要求我揭發他嗎?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Pope lifted a face full of suffering and said in his deep, vibrating
      voice, "Yes, yes! More than ever for that—a thousand times more than
      ever."
    </p>
    <p>
      教宗抬起充滿痛苦的臉孔，用他深沉且震動的聲音說，"是的，是的！對此，我一千倍，一萬倍的肯定。"
    </p>
    <p>"Then <i>I will do it</i>," said Roma.</p>
    <p>"那我就做吧," 羅馬說。</p>
    <p>
      The Pope rose up in great emotion, laid both hands on her shoulder, and
      said, "Go in peace, my daughter, and may God grant you at least a little
      repose."
    </p>
    <p>
      教皇深受感動地站了起來，雙手放在她的肩膀上，說道，"平安地去吧，我的女兒，願上帝賜予你至少一些安息。"

    <p>
      After recitation of the Rosary, the Pope, who had kept his religious
      retreat throughout the day, announced, to the astonishment of his
      chamberlains, his desire to walk in the garden at night. With Father
      Pifferi carrying a long Etruscan lamp he walked down the dark corridors
      with their surprised <i>palfrenieri</i>, and across the open courtyards
      with their startled sentinels, to where the arches of the Vatican opened
      upon the soft spring sky.<span

    </p>
    <p>
      "在誦唸了玫瑰經後，這位終日維持宗教靜修的教宗，令他的侍臣大吃一驚，宣佈希望在夜晚散步在花園中。他與Pifferi神父一起，神父手持一盞長長的伊特魯里亞燈，他們穿越黑暗的走廊，讓驚訝的侍從們瞠目結舌，跨過開放的庭院，讓驚愕的哨兵們目瞪口呆，走到梵蒂岡的拱門開向柔和的春天天空的地方。"
    </p>
    <p>
      The night was warm and quiet, and the moon, which had just risen and was
      near the full, shone with steady brilliance.
    </p>
    <p>夜晚溫暖寧靜，剛剛升起並且接近滿月的月亮，以穩定的輝煌照亮了天空。</p>
    <p>
      The venerable old men walked without speaking, and only the beating of
      their sticks on the gravel seemed to break the empty air. At length the
      Pope stopped and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      `這兩位尊敬的老人默默行走，只有他們的手杖擊打礫石的聲音似乎打破了空蕩蕩的空氣。終於，教皇停下來說道：`
    </p>
    <p>"How strange it all was, Father Pifferi!"</p>
    <p>"多奇怪的一切啊，皮菲里神父！"</p>
    <p>"Very strange, your Holiness," said the Capuchin.</p>
    <p>"您的聖善，真是奇怪。"這是 Capuchin 曾經說過的。</p>
    <p>"Rossi is not his name, it seems."</p>
    <p>"羅西並非他的真名，看來。"</p>
    <p>"'Not <i>really</i> his name' was what she said."</p>
    <p>“她說，'其實不是他的名字'。”</p>
    <p>
      "His mother was deceived by every one, and she drowned herself in the
      Tiber."
    </p>
    <p>"他的母親被每個人欺騙，她在台伯河中投身自盡。"</p>
    <p>"That was so, your Holiness."</p>
    <p>"確實如此，您的聖下。"</p>
    <p>
      "He was nursed in the Foundling, brought up in the Campagna, and then sold
      as a boy into England."
    </p>
    <p>
      "他在孤兒院中被撫養長大，在Campagna度過了童年，然後作為一個男孩被賣到了英格蘭。"
    </p>
    <p>"It is really extraordinary," said Father Pifferi.</p>
    <p>"真是非常了不起," Pifferi神父說。</p>
    <p>"Most extraordinary," repeated the Pope.</p>
    <p>"實在非常不尋常,"教皇重複說道.</p>
    <p>
      They looked steadily at each other for a moment, and then walked on in
      silence. Little sparks of blue light pulsed and throbbed and floated
      before their faces, and the moon itself, like a greater firefly, came and
      went in the interstices of the thin-leaved trees. The Pope, who shuffled
      in his walking, stopped again.
    </p>
    <p>
      他們彼此直視了一會兒，然後默默地繼續前行。小小的藍色火花在他們面前跳動、閃爍、飄動，就像更大的螢火蟲一般，月亮在薄葉樹的空隙中出現又消失。教皇走路時有些拖沓，於是又停下來。
    </p>
    <p>"Your Holiness?"</p>
    <p>"您的神聖呢？"</p>
    <p>"Who can he be, I wonder?"</p>
    <p>"他究竟是誰，我在想呢？"</p>
    <p>
      The Capuchin drew a deep breath. "We shall know everything to-morrow
      morning."
    </p>
    <p>"卡普奇恩深深地吸了口氣。他說：“我們將在明天早晨知道所有事情。”"</p>
    <p>"Yes," said the Pope, "we shall know everything to-morrow morning."</p>
    <p>"是的,"教皇說,"我們將在明早知道一切。"</p>
    <p>
      Some dark phantom of the past was hovering about them, and they were
      afraid to challenge it.
    </p>
    <p>他們周圍盤旋著過去的某種陰暗幻影，他們不敢挑戰它。</p>
    <p>
      At that moment the silence of the listening air was broken by a long clear
      call, which rang out through the night without any warning, and then
      stopped as suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      那一刻，靜聽的氣氛被一聲長而清晰的呼喚打破，它毫無預警地在夜晚中響起，然後突然停止。
    </p>
    <p>"The nightingale," said the Pope.</p>
    <p>"夜鶯，"教皇說。</p>
    <p>
      A mighty flood of melody floated down from some unseen place, in varying
      strains of divine music broken by many pauses, and running through every
      phase of jubilation, sorrow, and pain. It ended in a low wail of
      unutterable sadness, a pleading, yearning cry of anguish, which seemed to
      call on God Himself to hear. When it was over, and all was hushed around,
      the world seemed to have become void.
    </p>
    <p>
      從某個看不見的地方傾瀉下來的強大旋律，像神聖的音樂的變奏，中間斷斷續續，貫穿著每一個喜悅、悲傷和痛苦的階段。它以無法言喻的悲傷低吟結束，一種乞求、渴望的痛苦呼喚，彷彿在呼喚上帝自己來聆聽。當一切結束，周遭萬籟俱寂後，世界似乎成為了虛無。
    </p>
    <p>
      The Pope's feet shuffled on the gravel. "I shall never forget it," he
      said.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00462" title="363"
        ><a id="Page_363" title="363"></a
      ></span>
    </p>
    <p>教宗的腳在碎石上拖著。他說：“我永遠不會忘記的。”</p>
    <p>"It was wonderful," said the Capuchin.</p>
    <p>"那真是太棒了,"那位卡普奇諾修士說。</p>
    <p>
      "I was thinking of that poor lady," said the Pope. "Her pleading voice
      will ring in my ears as long as I live."
    </p>
    <p>
      “我正在想那位可憐的女士，”教皇說，“她懇求的聲音將在我耳邊響徹，直到我離開人世。”
    </p>
    <p>"Poor child!" said the Capuchin.</p>
    <p>"可憐的孩子!"這位卡普奇諾修士說。</p>
    <p>
      "After all, we could not have acted otherwise. Don't you think so, Father
      Pifferi? Considering everything, we could not possibly have acted
      otherwise."
    </p>
    <p>
      "畢竟，我們不可能有其他的行動方式。
      Pifferi神父，你不這麼認為嗎？考慮到所有事情，我們絕對不可能有其他的行動方式。"
    </p>
    <p>"Perhaps we could not, your Holiness."</p>
    <p>"或許我們不能，您的聖潔。"</p>
    <p>
      They turned the bend of an avenue, where the path under their feet rustled
      with the thick blossom shed from the overhanging Judas trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      他們拐過一條大道的轉彎處，在他們腳下的小徑上，滿是從高掛的紫荊樹上落下的濃密花朵，發出沙沙的聲音。
    </p>
    <p>
      "Surely this is where the little mother bird used to be," said the Pope.
    </p>
    <p>"肯定這就是小母鳥過去常在的地方，"教皇說。</p>
    <p>"So it is," said the friar.</p>
    <p>"是的，"那位修道士說。</p>
    <p>
      "Strange, she has not sprung out as usual. Ah, Meesh is not here, and
      perhaps that's the reason." And feeling for the old sarcophagus, the Pope
      put his hand gently down into it. A moment afterwards he said in another
      tone: "Father, the young birds are gone."
    </p>
    <p>
      "奇怪，她通常會跳出來的，但現在沒有。啊，米什不在這，或訂這就是原因。"教宗手輕輕地探入了那個古老的石棺，尋找它。片刻後，他用另一種語氣說道："父親，小鳥不見了。"
    </p>
    <p>"Flown, no doubt," said the friar.</p>
    <p>"無疑是飛走了,"神父說。</p>
    <p>
      "No. See," said the Pope, and he brought up a little nest filled with a
      ruin of fluff and feathers.
    </p>
    <p>"不，你看，"教皇說，並拿出了一個裝滿絨毛和羽毛的小巢。</p>
    <p>"Meesh has been here indeed," said the friar.</p>
    <p>"的確，Meesh曾經在這裡," 和尚說。</p>
    <p>
      The venerable old men walked on in silence until they re-entered the
      vaulted courtyards of the Vatican. Then the Pope turned to the Capuchin
      and said in a breaking voice, "You'll go with the poor lady to the Procura
      in the morning, Father Pifferi. If the magistrates ask questions which
      they should not ask, you will protect her, and even forbid her to reply,
      and if she breaks down at the last moment you will support and comfort
      her. After that ... we must leave all to the Holy Spirit. God's hand is in
      this thing ... it is in everything. He will bring out all things well—well
      for us, well for the Church, well for the poor lady, and even for her
      husband, whoever he may be."

      "那些可敬的老人沉默地走著，直到他們重新進入梵蒂岡的拱形庭院。然後教皇轉向Capuchin，用斷斷續續的聲音說道：“您明早會和那位可憐的女士一起去Procura的，Pifferi父親。如果法官提出他們不應該問的問題，您會保護她，甚至禁止她回答，如果她在最後一刻崩潰，你將會支援並安慰她。那之後......我們必須將一切交給神聖的靈魂。此事中有上帝的手......它在所有事物中。他會讓所有事情都很好——對於我們來說，對於教會，對於那位可憐的女士，甚至對於她的丈夫，無論他可能是誰。”
    </p>
    <p>"Whoever he may be," repeated the Capuchin.</p>
    <p>"無論他可能是誰," 那個卡布奇諾修道士重複說道.</p>

      Early in the morning of Holy Saturday, Roma was summoned as a witness
      before the Penal Tribunal of Rome. The citation, which was signed by a
      magistrate, required that<span
        class="x-ebookmaker-pageno"
        id="pgepubid00464"
        title="364"
        ><a id="Page_364" title="364"></a
      ></span>
      she should present herself at the Procura at ten o'clock the same day, "to
      depose about facts on which she would then be interrogated," and she was
      warned that if she did not appear, "she would incur the punishment
      sanctioned by Article 176 of the Code of Penal Procedure."
    </p>
    <p>
      在聖週六的清晨，羅馬被傳喚為羅馬刑事法庭的證人。該傳票由法官簽署，要求她在同一天的十點鐘在檢察院現身，“將對她將被質問的事實進行證述”，並警告她如果她未出現，“她將受到刑事程序法第176條規定的懲罰。”
    </p>
    <p>
      Roma found Father Pifferi waiting for her at the door of the Procura. The
      old Capuchin looked anxious. He glanced at her pale face and quivering
      lips and inquired if she had slept. She answered that she was well, and
      they turned to go upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      羅馬在Procura的門口發現了等待她的Pifferi神父。老卡普奇看上去很焦慮。他看了看她蒼白的臉和顫抖的嘴唇，問她是否已經睡覺。她回答說她很好，然後他們轉身去樓上。
    </p>
    <p>
      On the landing of the first floor Commendatore Angelelli, who was wearing
      a flower in his button-hole, approached them with smiles and quick bows to
      lead them to the office of the magistrate.
    </p>
    <p>
      在一樓的樓梯平臺，配戴著胸針上的花的Commendatore
      Angelelli熱烈地微笑著並快速鞠躬，領導他們前往法官的辦公室。
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only a form," said the Questore. "It will be nothing—nothing at all."
    </p>
    <p>"只是一種形式而已，"探長說，"這將是沒有——完全沒有任何東西。"</p>
    <p>
      Commendatore Angelelli led the way into a silent room furnished in red,
      with carpet, couch, armchairs, table, a stove, and two large portraits of
      the King and Queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      `安吉萊利指揮官帶領我們走進一個裝飾成紅色的安靜房間，房間裡有地毯、沙發、扶手椅、桌子、爐子，以及國王和王后的兩幅大肖像。`
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sit down, please. Make yourselves comfortable," said the Chief of Police,
      and he passed into an adjoining room.
    </p>
    <p>"請坐下，讓自己舒服些，"警察局長說，然後他走進了隔壁的房間。</p>
    <p>
      A moment afterwards he returned with two other men. One of them was an
      elderly gentleman, who wore with his frockcoat a close-fitting velvet cap
      decorated with two bands of gold lace. This was the Procurator General,
      and the other, a younger man, carrying a portfolio, was his private
      secretary. A marshal of Carabineers came to the door for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      片刻後，他帶著另外兩個人回來。其中一個是一位年紀較長的紳士，他在大衣上戴著一頂合身的天鵝絨帽，帽子上裝飾著兩條金邊。這是檢察總長，而另一個年輕人帶著公事包，是他的私人秘書。一位憲兵隊隊長瞬間來到門口。
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't be afraid, my child. No harm shall come to you," whispered Father
      Pifferi. But the good Capuchin himself was trembling visibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "別害怕，我的孩子。你不會受到傷害，"Father
      Pifferi低聲道。但是這位善良的卡皮欽修士自己也在顯而易見地震顫。
    </p>
    <p>
      The Procurator General was gentle and polite, but he dismissed the Chief
      of Police, and would have dismissed the Capuchin also, but for vehement
      protests.
    </p>
    <p>
      總檢察長雖然溫和有禮，但他解僱了警察局長，若非強烈的抗議，他也會解僱那位加普教林僧侶。
    </p>
    <p>"Very well, I see no objection; sit down again," he said.</p>
    <p>"好吧，我無異議；再坐下來，"他說。</p>
    <p>
      It was a strange three-cornered interview. Father Pifferi, quaking with
      fear, thought he was there to protect Roma. The Procurator General,
      smiling and serene, thought she had come to complete a secret scheme of
      personal revenge. And Roma herself, sitting erect in her chair, in her
      black Eton coat and straw hat, and with her wonderful eyes turning slowly
      from face to face, thought only of Rossi, and was silent and calm.<span

      ></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      這是一場奇特的三方面談話。皮菲利神父，恐懼得發抖，以為他在那裡是為了保護羅馬。而總檢察官，笑容滿面，寧靜自若，以為她來完成一個秘密的個人報復計劃。至於羅馬本人，她坐在椅子上，身直如杆，穿著黑色的伊頓大衣和草帽，她那驚人的眼睛慢慢地從一張臉移至另一張臉，只想著羅西，默不作聲，鎮靜自如。
    </p>
    <p>
      The secretary opened his portfolio on the table and prepared to write. The
      Procurator General sat in front of Roma and leaned slightly forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      `秘書在桌子上開啟他的公文包，準備寫作。
      總檢察長坐在羅馬前面，稍微向前傾斜。`
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are Donna Roma Volonna, daughter of the late Prince Prospero
      Volonna?"
    </p>
    <p>"您是已故的Prospero Volonna王子的女兒，Donna Roma Volonna嗎？"</p>
    <p>"I am."</p>
    <p>"我是。"</p>
    <p>"You were born in England and lived there as a child?"</p>
    <p>"你在英國出生並在那裡度過了童年嗎？"</p>
    <p>"Yes."</p>
    <p>"是的。"</p>
    <p>
      "Although you were young when you lost your father, you have a perfect
      recollection both of him and of his associates?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "雖然你在失去父親時還很年輕，但你對他和他的朋友有著完美的回憶，對吧？"
    </p>
    <p>"Of some of his associates."</p>
    <p>"他的一些夥伴。"</p>
    <p>
      "One of them was a young man who lived in his house as a kind of adopted
      son?"
    </p>
    <p>"其中一個是作為一種被收養的兒子在他的房子裡居住的年輕人?"</p>
    <p>"Yes."</p>
    <p>"是的。"</p>

      "You are aware that your father was unhappily involved in political
      troubles?"

    <p>"你知道你的父親不幸地捲入了政治麻煩中嗎？"</p>
    <p>"I am."</p>
    <p>"我是。"</p>
    <p>"You know that he was arrested on a serious charge?"</p>
    <p>"你知道他因嚴重的罪名而被捕了嗎？"</p>
    <p>"I do."</p>
    <p>"我願意。"</p>
    <p>
      "You also know that, when condemned to death by a military tribunal for
      conspiring against the person of the late sovereign, his sentence was
      commuted by the King, but that one of his associates, condemned at the
      same time, and for the same crime, escaped all punishment because he was
      not then at the disposition of the law?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "你也知道，當他因為密謀對抗已故君主的人身而被軍事法庭判處死刑時，他的刑罰被國王寬免了。但是，他的一個同謀者在同一時間，因為同樣的罪行被判處死刑，卻因為當時不在法律的制裁下而完全逃過了懲罰。"
    </p>
    <p>"Yes."</p>
    <p>"是的。"</p>
    <p>"That was the young man who lived with him as his adopted son?"</p>
    <p>"那是和他一起生活的被領養的兒子嗎?"</p>
    <p>"It was."</p>
    <p>"這是的。"</p>
    <p>
      There was a moment's pause during which nothing could be heard but the
      quick breathing of the Capuchin and the scratching of the secretary's pen.
    </p>
    <p>
      `有一刻的停頓，期間只能聽到卡普錫恩修士的急促呼吸和秘書筆尖的劃過紙張的聲音。`

      "During the past few months you have made the acquaintance in Rome of the
      Deputy David Rossi?"
    </p>
    <p>"在過去的幾個月裡，你在羅馬認識了代表大衛·羅西嗎？"</p>
    <p>"I have."</p>
    <p>"我有。"</p>
    <p>
      The Capuchin moved in his seat. "Acquaintance! The lady is married to the
      Deputy."
    </p>
    <p>`這個閣主在他的座位上移動。 "熟人！那位女士已經嫁給了副議長。"`</p>
    <p>The Procurator General's eyes rose perceptibly. "Married!"</p>
    <p>"檢察總長的眼睛明顯地抬起來。“結婚了！”"</p>
    <p>
      "That is to say religiously married, which is all the Church thinks
      necessary."
    </p>
    <p>"也就是說，他們在宗教上結婚，這是教會認為必要的一切。"</p>
    <p>
      "Ah, I see," said the Procurator General, suppressing a<span

      name."
    </p>
    <p>
      "啊，我明白了，"總檢察長抑制住笑意說道。"不過，我必須要求這位女士用她的本名來陳述。"
    </p>
    <p>"Go on, sir," said the Capuchin.</p>
    <p>"請繼續，先生，"那位卡普洛教士說。</p>
    <p>
      "Your intimacy with the Honourable Rossi has no doubt led him to speak
      freely on many subjects?"
    </p>
    <p>"與榮譽的羅西先生的親密關係，無疑使他在許多主題上開誠布公地談話了吧?"</p>
    <p>"It has."</p>
    <p>"它已經有了。"</p>
    <p>"He has perhaps told you that Rossi was not his father's name."</p>
    <p>"他可能已經告訴你，羅西不是他父親的名字。"</p>
    <p>"Yes."</p>
    <p>"是的。"</p>
    <p>
      "That it was his mother's name, and though strictly his legal name also,
      he has borne it only since his return to Rome?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "這是他母親的名字，並且儘管這也是他的合法名字，但自從他返回羅馬後，他才一直使用它？"
    </p>
    <p>"That is so."</p>
    <p>"那就是如此。"</p>
    <p>
      It was the Capuchin's turn to look surprised. His sandalled feet shuffled
      on the carpet, and he prepared to take snuff.
    </p>
    <p>
      這時候，卡普奇諾修道士也顯得驚訝。他穿著涼鞋的腳在地毯上擦來擦去，並準備嗅鼻煙。
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Honourable Rossi has been some weeks abroad, and during his absence
      you have no doubt received letters from him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "尊貴的羅西先生已經在外面待了幾周，他不在的期間，你們無疑收到了他的信件吧？"
    </p>
    <p>"I have."</p>
    <p>"我有。"</p>
    <p>
      "Can you tell me if in any of these letters he has said anything of a
      certain revolutionary propaganda?"
    </p>
    <p>"你能告訴我，在這些信中，他是否有提到過某種革命宣傳？"</p>
    <p>
      The Capuchin, with his finger and thumb half raised, stopped and said, "I
      forbid the question, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "這位卡普奇諾教士，他的手指和拇指微微抬起，停下來並說，"我禁止這個問題，先生。"

    <p>"Father General!"</p>
    <p>"總會長!"</p>
    <p>"I mean that I counsel the lady not to answer it."</p>
    <p>"我是說，我建議那位女士不要回答它。"</p>
    <p>
      The Procurator General suppressed another smile, directed this time at
      Roma, and said, "<i>Bene!</i>"
    </p>
    <p>"檢察總長壓制了另一次微笑，這次是對羅馬說的，並說，「好!」"</p>
    <p>"Be calm, my daughter," whispered the Capuchin.</p>
    <p>"安靜些，我的女兒，"那卡皮欽低聲細語。</p>
    <p>
      "At least," said the Procurator General, "you can now be certain that you
      had seen the Honourable Rossi before you met him in Rome?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "至少，"檢察總長說，"你現在可以確定在羅馬遇見尊貴的羅西之前，你已經見過他了吧?"
    </p>
    <p>"I can."</p>
    <p>"我可以。"</p>
    <p>
      "In fact you recognise in the illustrious Deputy the young man condemned
      in contumacy eighteen years ago?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "事實上，您在這位傑出的代警中認出了十八年前被判有罪而不在現場的那個年輕人嗎？"

    <p>"I do."</p>
    <p>"我願意。"</p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps in his letters or conversations he has even admitted the
      identity?"
    </p>
    <p>"也許在他的信件或對話中，他甚至承認了這個身分?"</p>
    <p>"He has."</p>
    <p>"他有。"</p>

      "Courage, my child," whispered the Capuchin, taking Roma's ice-cold hand
      in his own trembling one.

    <p>
      "鼓起勇氣，我的孩子，"Capuchin低聲說到，並將自己顫抖的手放在Roma冰冷的手中。

    <p>"他的年輕同盟者的名字是——"</p>

      "David Leone," said Roma, lifting her eyes to the face of Father Pifferi.
    </p>
    <p>"「大衛·萊昂」，羅馬說，她抬起眼睛看向父親皮費裡的臉。"</p>
    <p>"So David Leone and David Rossi are one and the same person?"</p>
    <p>"所以，David Leone和David Rossi是同一個人嗎？"</p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Roma, and the Capuchin dropped back in his seat as if he had
      been dealt a blow.
    </p>
    <p>"是的，"羅馬說，而那個Capuchin像被打了一樣倒在他的座位上。</p>

    <p>"謝謝你。我不再需要你的幫助。我的秘書現在將準備摘要。"</p>

      Commendatore Angelelli returned with the Carabineer, and there was some
      talking in low tones. "Report for the Committee of the Chamber, sir?"
      "That is unnecessary at this moment, the House having risen for Easter."
      "Warrant for the arrest, then?" "Certainly. Here is the form. Fill it up,
      and I will sign."

      "安傑萊利指揮官帶著卡拉比尼爾回來了，他們兩人在低聲交談。"向議會委員會報告，先生？"
      "現在沒有必要，因為議會已經為復活節休會了。" "那麼，逮捕令？"
      "當然。這是表格。填好它，我會簽字的。"
    </p>
    <p>
      While the secretary wrote his <i>précis</i> at one side of the table, the
      Chief of Police prepared his <i>mandato</i> at the other side, repeating
      the words to the Carabineer who stood behind his chair. "We ...
      considering the conclusions of the Public Minister ... according to
      Article 187 of the Code ... order the arrest of David Leone, commonly
      called David Rossi ... imputed guilty of attempted regicide in the year
      ... and tried and condemned in contumacy for the crime contemplated in
      Article.... And to such effects we require the Corps of the Royal
      Carabineers to conduct him before us to be interrogated on the facts above
      stated, and call on all officials and agents of the public force to lend a

      "我們...考慮到公眾部長的結論...根據法典第187條...命令逮捕 David
      Leone，通常被稱為 David
      Rossi...被指控在該年份發生的未遂王室謀殺案中有罪，並因涉嫌受到該條例條件的犯罪而被判處藐視法庭。

      When the secretary had finished his <i>précis</i> he read it aloud to Roma
      and his superior.

      that will do."

      Roma and Father Pifferi had both risen. "Courage," the Capuchin tried to
      say, but his quivering lips emitted no sound. Roma stood a moment with the
      pen in her fingers, and her great eyes looked slowly round the room. Then
      she stooped and wrote her name rapidly.<span

      羅馬和皮費裡神父都站了起來。“勇氣”，這位Capuchin試著說，但他顫抖的嘴唇沒有發出聲音。羅馬握著筆站了一會兒，她的大眼睛慢慢地環顧著房間。然後她彎下腰迅速地寫下自己的名字。
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same moment the Procurator General signed the warrant, whereupon
      the Chief of Police handed it to the Carabineer, saying, "Lose no
      time—Chiasso," and the soldier went out hurriedly.

      "就在總檢察長簽署逮捕令的同時，警察局長將它交給了憲兵，說道，“別浪費時間——去基亞索吧，”然後士兵急忙出去了。"

      There was a crowd on the embankment by the corner of the Ripetta bridge.
      The body of a beggar had been brought out of the river, and it was lying
      there for the formal inspection of the officials who report on cases of
      sudden death. Roma stopped to look at the dead man. It was Old John. He
      had committed suicide.

      It was said at the Vatican that the Pope had not slept all night. The
      attendant whose duty it was to lie awake while the Holy Father expected to
      sleep said he heard him praying in the dark hours, and at one moment he
      heard him singing a hymn.

      據梵蒂岡表示，教宗整晚未曾入眠。負責在神聖之父想要安睡時守夜的侍從表示，他聽見教宗在黑暗的時間裡禱告，並在某一刻，他聽見他唱起了聖歌。

      First the Conclave, the three scrutators, and himself as one of them. The
      first scrutiny, the second scrutiny, the third scrutiny and his own name
      going up, up, up, as he proclaimed the votes in a loud voice so that all
      in the chapel might hear. One vote more to his own name, another, still
      another; his fear, his fainting; the gentle tones of an old Cardinal,
      saying, "Take your time, brother; rest, repose a while." Then the
      election, the awful sense of being God's choice, the almost unearthly joy
      of the supreme moment when he became the Vicar of Christ on earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      `首先是秘密會議，有三位票數察看員，他本身就是其中的一員。第一次審查，第二次審查，第三次審查，他自己的名字一路上升，上升，上升，當他在教堂裡以大聲宣讀票數，讓所有人都能聽見。他的名字多了一票，再多一票，還有更多；他的恐懼，他的暈厥；一位年老的樞機主教溫和的語調說，"慢點，兄弟；休息一下，暫時放鬆一下。"然後是選舉，被神選中的可怕感覺，當他成為基督在地球上的代表那一刻，那種幾乎超凡脫俗的快樂。`

    <p>
      Then the stepping forth from the dim conclave into the full light of day
      to be proclaimed the representative of the Almighty, the living voice of
      God, the infallible one. The sunless chapel, the white and crimson
      vestments, the fisherman's ring, the vast crowd in the blazing light of
      the piazza, the sudden silence, and the clear cry of the Cardinal Deacon
      ringing out under the blue sky, "I announce to you joyful tidings—the Most
      Eminent and Reverend Cardinal Leone,<span

      having taken the name of Pius X., is elected Pope." Then the call of
      silver trumpets, the roar of ten thousand human throats, the surging mass
      of living men below the balcony, and the joy-bells ringing out the glad
      news from every church tower in Rome, that a new King and Pontiff had been
      given by God to His World.
    </p>
    <p>
      然後，從昏暗的秘密會議廳中走出，步入充滿陽光的白天中，被宣佈為全能者的代表，神的活聲音，無錯的人。無陽的禮拜堂，白色和鮮紅色的禮服，漁夫的戒指，廣場上炮烙的燈光中的大眾，突然的寂靜，然後是在藍天底下響亮的尖叫聲，牧師首輔宣告的歡喜的訊息：“我向你宣佈一個喜悅的訊息-最尊者和修克雷恩樞機主教，取名為庇護十世，被選為教宗。”然後是銀色喇叭的呼喚，一萬人的喉嚨狂吼，陽臺下人潮湧動，喜悅的鐘聲從羅馬每個教堂的塔樓中響起，宣告新的國王和舉行被上帝賜予他的世界。
    </p>
    <p>
      Somewhere in the dark hours the Pope dozed off, and then Sleep, the maker
      of visions, dispelled his dream. Another picture—a picture which had
      pursued him at intervals both in sleeping and waking hours, ever since the
      great day when he stepped out on to the balcony and was saluted as a
      god—came to him again that night. He called it his presentiment. The scene
      was always the same. A darkened room, a chapel, an altar, himself on his
      knees, with the sense of Someone bending over him, and an awful voice
      saying into his ears:—"You, the Vicar of Jesus Christ; you, the rock on
      which the Saviour built His Church; you, the living voice of God; you, the
      infallible one; you, who fill the most exalted dignity on earth—<i
        >remember you are but clay!</i
      >"
    </p>
    <p>
      在黑暗的時刻，教皇不知不覺間昏睡過去，然後夢，這視覺的創造者，驅散了他的夢。另一幅畫面-自從他踏上陽臺並被尊稱為神的偉大日子以來，無論在睡眠還是清醒的時候，這幅畫面時不時地追逐著他-那個夜晚再次出現在他面前。他稱之為他的預感。場景始終如一。一間昏暗的房間，一座禮拜堂，一個祭壇，他跪在那裡，感覺到有人在他身上彎腰，一個可怕的聲音在他的耳畔說道：“你，耶穌基督的代表；你，救世主建立他的教會的磐石；你，神的活聲；你，無可置疑的一人；你，你填補了地球上最崇高的尊嚴-記住你只是黏土！”
    </p>
    <p>
      The Pope awoke with a start, and to break the oppression of painful
      thoughts he turned on the light, propped himself up in bed, and taking a
      book from the night table, he began to read. It was the Catholic legend of
      a father doomed to destroy his son, or suffer the son to destroy the
      father. They had been separated early in the son's life, and now that they
      met again they met as foes, and the son drew his sword upon his father
      without knowing who he was!
    </p>
    <p>
      教皇驚醒，為了打破痛苦思考的壓迫，他開了燈，撐著床鋪，從床頭櫃拿出一本書開始讀。這是一個天主教的傳說，一個父親註定要毀滅他的兒子，或者讓兒子毀滅他。他們在兒子年幼時就被分開，現在他們再次相遇，但是成為了敵人，兒子甚至在不知道他是自己父親的情況下對他揮劍！
    </p>
    <p>
      One by one the incidents of the history linked themselves with the
      incidents of the day before, and the lonely old man of the
      Vatican—childless, kinless, homeless for all his state, and cut off from
      every human tie—began to think of things that were still farther back than
      the conclave and the proclamation—things of the dead past which nature had
      seemed to bury with so kind a hand, covering the grave with grass and
      flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      `歷史的每一個事件都與前一天的事件相連，悠然獨居在梵蒂岡的老人——儘管身份顯赫，但卻無子無親，沒有家，被切斷了所有的人情世故——開始想起比秘密教會會議和宣言更遙遠的事情——這些已經死去的過去，自然似乎用善良的手掩蓋了它們，用草和花覆蓋了墓地。`

      A sweet young face, timid and trustful; a sudden shock such as makes the
      world crumble beneath a man's feet; a vague sense of guilt and shame,
      unreasonable, unmerited, unjustifiable, yet not to be put away; a blank
      period of humiliation; the opening of eyes in a new world; the humblest
      place in a religious house, the kitchen of the Noviciate. Then a great
      yearning, a great restlessness; coming out of the convent;<span

    </p>
    <p>
      The Pope put down the book and turned out the light. It was then that he
      sang and prayed.
    </p>
    <p>教宗放下了書，熄滅了燈。正是在那時，他唱歌和祈禱。</p>
    <p>
      When Cortis came with the Pope's breakfast in the frayed edge of the
      morning, the chamberlain outside the bedroom door whispered to the valet,
      "The Holy Father has been with the angels all night long."
    </p>
    <p>
      當Cortis在疲憊的清晨為教皇端來早餐時，臥室門外的侍衛對僕人悄聲說：“聖父整夜都在與天使相伴。”
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a Papal "Chapel" in St. Peter's that morning, with a procession
      of white vestments in honour of the Mass of the Resurrection, but the Pope
      did not attend. He sat alone in his simple chamber, with curtains drawn
      across the marble columns to obscure the bed, fingering the crucifix which
      hung from his neck, and waiting for the ringing of the Easter bells.
    </p>
    <p>
      那天早晨，聖彼得大教堂內有一個教宗的"禮拜室"，一行白色祭服的禮隊正在尊貴的復活日彌撒的榮耀中進行，但教宗並未出席。他獨自坐在他簡單的房間裡，窗簾拉上遮住了大理石柱子以遮蔽床鋪，他在輕輕撫摸著掛在他脖子上的十字架，等待復活節鐘鈴的響起。
    </p>
    <p>
      The little door to the private corridor opened quietly, and Father Pifferi
      entered the room.
    </p>
    <p>`私人通道的小門悄然開啟，皮菲里神父走進了房間。`</p>
    <p>"Well?" said the Pope.</p>
    <p>"那麼？"教皇說。</p>
    <p>"It is all over," said the Capuchin.</p>
    <p>"一切都結束了,"那個 Capuchin 說。</p>
    <p>"Did the poor child ... did she bear up bravely?"</p>
    <p>"那個可憐的孩子...她表現得堅強嗎？"</p>
    <p>"Very bravely, your Holiness."</p>
    <p>"非常勇敢，您的聖潔。"</p>
    <p>
      "No weakness, no hysteria? She did not faint or break down at the end?"
    </p>
    <p>"沒有軟弱，沒有歇斯底里？她在最後沒有昏倒或崩潰嗎？"</p>
    <p>"On the contrary, she was composed—perfectly composed and quiet."</p>
    <p>"相反，她很冷靜——非常冷靜和安靜。"</p>
    <p>"Thank God!"</p>
    <p>"感謝上帝！"</p>
    <p>
      "It was most extraordinary. A woman denouncing her husband, and yet so
      calm, so terribly calm."
    </p>
    <p>
      "這真是最不尋常的事。一位女人在指責她的丈夫，但卻如此冷靜，如此可怕地冷靜。"
    </p>
    <p>
      "God helped her to bear her burden. God help all of us in our hour of
      need!"
    </p>
    <p>"神幫助她承擔困擾。在我們最需要的時候，神幫助我們所有的人！"</p>
    <p>The Pope lifted the crucifix to his lips, and added, "And the man?"</p>
    <p>教皇將十字架舉到嘴唇上，並補充說，“那個男人呢？”</p>
    <p>"Rossi?"</p>
    <p>"羅西?"</p>
    <p>"Yes."</p>
    <p>"是的。"</p>
    <p>
      "After she had signed the denunciation a warrant for his arrest was made
      out and given to the Carabineers."
    </p>
    <p>"在她簽署了那份控訴書後，他的逮捕令便被簽發並交給了憲兵。"</p>
    <p>"It mentioned everything?"</p>
    <p>"它提到了所有事情嗎？"</p>
    <p>"Everything."</p>
    <p>"一切。"</p>
    <p>"Who he is and all about him?"</p>
    <p>"他是誰以及他的所有情況?"</p>
    <p>"Yes, your Holiness."</p>
    <p>"是的，您的聖善。"</p>
    <p>
      The Pope fingered his crucifix again, and said, "Who is he, Father
      Pifferi?"<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00472" title="371"
        ><a id="Page_371" title="371"></a
      ></span>
    </p>
    <p>教皇再次摸了摸他的十字架，然後問道，“他是誰，皮菲里神父？”</p>
    <p>The Capuchin did not reply.</p>
    <p>該卡普奇諾未作回應。</p>
    <p>"Father Pifferi, I ask you who he is?"</p>
    <p>"皮菲里神父，我問你他是誰？"</p>
    <p>
      Still the Capuchin did not reply, and the Pope smiled a pitiful smile,
      touched the friar's arm with a caressing gesture, and said, "Don't be
      afraid for the Holy Father, carissimo. If that poor child, who would have
      died rather than sacrifice her husband, could be so calm and strong...."
    </p>
    <p>
      "儘管如此，那個卡普奇養生士仍未回答，教皇帶著可憐的笑容摸了摸士兵的手臂，做了一個撫摸的姿態，然後說道，“不要為神聖之父擔憂，我的親愛的。如果那個可憐的孩子，寧願死也不願犧牲她的丈夫，能保持如此的冷靜和堅強......”
    </p>
    <p>
      "Holy Father," said the Capuchin, "when you asked the lady to denounce
      David Rossi you thought of him only as an enemy of the Church and of its
      head, trying to pull down both and destroy civil society—isn't that so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "聖父,"那個卡普奇諾修士說，"當您要求那位女士揭發大衛·羅西時，您只是把他當作教會和教宗的敵人，試圖搞垮兩者並破壞公民社會——是這樣嗎?"
    </p>
    <p>The Pope bent his head.</p>
    <p>教皇低下了他的頭。</p>
    <p>
      "Holy Father, if ... if you had known that he was something more than that
      ... something nearer ... if, for example, you had been told that ... that
      he was the relative of a priest, would you have asked for his denunciation
      just the same?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "教宗聖父，如果...如果您知道他的身份不止於此...更接近一些...例如，如果有人告訴您...他是神父的親戚，您會否還是要求指控他呢？"
    </p>
    <p>
      The old Capuchin had stammered, but the Pope answered in a firm voice,
      "That would have made no difference, my son. The blessed Scriptures do not
      conceal the sin of Judas, and shall we conceal the offences of those who
      come within the circle of our own families?"
    </p>
    <p>
      那位年老的Capuchin僧人結結巴巴地說話，但教皇卻以堅定的聲音回答，
      “這不會有任何差別，我的兒子。祝福的經文並未掩蓋猶達斯的罪孽，我們應該隱瞞自己家庭圈子中的那些犯罪行為嗎？”
    </p>
    <p>
      "Holy Father," said the Capuchin, "if you had been told that he was
      related to a prelate of your domestic household...."
    </p>
    <p>
      "敬愛的教宗，"那個卡布奇諾教派的修士說，"如果有人告訴你他和你的家眷中的一位主教有關係...."
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped, and the Pope answered in a voice that trembled slightly,
      "Still it would have made no difference. The enemies of the Almighty are
      watching day and night, and shall His holy Church be imperilled and abased
      by the weakness of His servant?"
    </p>
    <p>
      他停了下來，教皇帶著微微顫抖的聲音回答道，
      "即使如此，這也不會有任何的變化。萬能者的敵人日夜都在觀察，他的神聖教會會因為他的僕人的軟弱而處於危險與屈辱中嗎?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Holy Father, if ... if you had been told that ... that he was the kinsman
      of a Cardinal?"
    </p>
    <p>"聖父，如果...如果有人告訴你... 他是樞機主教的親戚?"</p>
    <p>
      The Pope was struggling to control himself. "Even then it would have made
      no difference. I am old and weak, but God would have supported me, and
      though I had been called upon to cut off my right hand, or give my body to
      be burned, still...."
    </p>
    <p>
      教皇正在努力控制自己。"即使那樣也沒有任何差別。我已經老了，也很虛弱，但上帝會支援我，即使我被要求切掉我的右手，或者讓我的身體被燒掉，仍然......"
    </p>
    <p>
      His voice quivered and died in his throat, and there was a moment's pause.
    </p>
    <p>他的聲音在他的喉嚨中顫抖並消失，然後是一瞬間的停頓。</p>
    <p>
      "Holy Father," said the Capuchin, turning his eyes away, "if you had been
      told that he was the nearest of kin to the Pope himself...."
    </p>
    <p>
      "聖父，"
      那位卡普奇諾修士轉開眼睛說道，"如果你被告知他是與教宗本人最相近的親屬...."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Pope dropped the crucifix which was trembling in his<span
        class="x-ebookmaker-pageno"

      hand, and half rose from his chair. "Then ... even then ... it would have
      ... but the will of God be done," he said, and he could not utter another
      word.
    </p>
    <p>
      `教宗的手中的十字架因顫抖而掉落，他從椅子上站了一半起來。他說：“那麼……即使是那樣……本來也會……但願上帝的旨意成全”，他無法再說出一個字。`
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment the Easter bells began to ring. The deep-toned bells of St.
      Peter's came first with its joyful peal, and then the bells of the other
      churches of the city took up the rapturous melody. In the Basilica the
      veil before the altar had been rent with a loud crash, and the Gloria in
      Excelsis was being sung.
    </p>
    <p>
      那時候，復活節的鐘聲開始響起。首先是聖彼得大教堂的深沉鐘聲，帶著喜悅的和鳴，然後城市中其它教堂的鐘聲接續著狂喜的旋律。在聖殿中，祭壇前的帷幕已經被劇烈地撕裂，並且正在演唱《榮耀歸於至高者》。
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same moment a prelate vested in a white tunic entered the Pope's
      room, and kneeling in the middle of the floor, he said, "Holy Father, I
      announce to you a great joy. Hallelujah! The Lord is risen again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "就在那一刻，一名身著白色束腰衣的主教走進了教皇的房間，在房間中央跪下，他說，“聖父，我向您報告一個大喜的訊息。哈利路亞！
      主已再度復活了。”"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Pope tried to rise from his seat, but could not do so. "Help me,
      Monsignor," he said faintly, and the prelate raised him to his feet. Then
      leaning on the prelate's arm, he walked to the door of his private chapel.
      On reaching it he looked back at Father Pifferi, who was going silently
      out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      教皇試圖從座位上站起來，但未能做到。他微弱地說道，“幫助我，樞機主教。”於是神職人員扶他站起來。然後，他靠著樞機主教的手臂走向他的私人禮拜堂的門。到達之處，他回頭看著正在無聲無息地離開房間的Father
      Pifferi。
    </p>
    <p>
      "Addio, carissimo," he said, in a pitiful voice, but the Capuchin could
      not reply.
    </p>
    <p>"再見，我親愛的，"他以悲慟的語調說，但卻得不到卡普奇諾僧侶的回應。</p>
    <p>
      Some moments afterwards the Pope was quite alone. The arched windows of
      the little chapel were covered with heavy red curtains, but the clanging
      of the brass tongues in the cupola, the deep throb of the organ, and the
      rolling waves of the voices of the people singing the grand Hallelujah,
      found their way into the darkened chamber. But above all other sounds in
      the ears of the Pope as he lay prostrate on the altar steps was the sound
      of a voice which said, "You, the Vicar of Jesus Christ; you, the rock on
      which the Saviour built His Church; you, the living voice of God; you, the
      infallible one; you, who fill the most exalted dignity on earth—<i
        >remember you are but clay</i
      >."
    </p>
    <p>
      幾分鐘後，教皇完全獨自一人。小禮拜堂的拱形窗戶被重重的紅色窗簾覆蓋，但是圓頂上的銅鈴聲、風琴的深沉節拍，以及人們演唱哈利路亞的舉國同唱，都找到了進入昏暗室內的路徑。然而，當教皇躺在祭壇的臺階上時，在他耳朵裡超越所有其他聲音的，是一個聲音的聲音，它說：“你，是耶穌基督的代言人;你是救世主建立他教會的磐石;你是上帝的生活之聲;你，是無謬誤的一人;你，是擔任著地上最崇高的尊嚴——記住你只不過是黏土。”

      The street cries were ringing through the Navona, the piazza was alive
      with people, and strangers were saluting each other as they passed on the
      pavement when Roma returned home. At the lodge the Garibaldian wished her
      a good Easter, and at the door of the apartment the curate of the

      "The porter from Trinità de' Monti brought it," she said, "and he told me
      to tell you there's a lay sister called Sister Angelica at the convent

      you've got a letter, Signora? I thought Signora would die of delight, and
      I gave the man six soldi."

      "特里尼塔·德·蒙蒂的門房帶來了這信，"她說，"他告訴我要告訴你，現在修道院裡有一位名叫安吉利卡的修女，他擔心其他的信可能會被弄丟。您高興收到信了嗎，夫人？我以為夫人會歡天喜地，我給那個人六個索爾迪。"

      Roma was turning the envelope over and over in her hands, thinking what a
      call to joy a letter of Rossi's used to be, and wondering if she ought to
      open this one.

      "當湯馬索參加戰爭時，我也曾經有過這種感覺。但是今天是復活節，夫人，今天的聖母瑪麗肯定不會帶來壞消息。聽！那是歌頌聲。在聖週六，我總能聽到教堂的鐘聲。我剛剛失聰的時候，約瑟夫還是個嬰兒。當鐘聲響起時，我會把他小腳包裹的布條取下，他竟然立刻起來走路！哦，我可憐的寶貝！…但是我讓夫人流淚了。"

    <p style="padding-top: 0.5em">
      "<span class="smcap">My dear Roma</span>,—Your letters and I seem to be
      running a race which shall return to you first. I was compelled to leave
      Berlin before my long-delayed correspondence could arrive from London, and
      now it seems probable that I must leave Zürich before it can follow me
      from Berlin. As a consequence I have not heard from you for weeks—not
      since your letter about your friend, you remember—and I am in agonies of
      impatience to know what has happened to you in the interval.

    <p style="padding-top: 0.5em">
      "親愛的羅馬，你的來信和我似乎正在進行一場比賽，看看誰能先回到你那裡。在我從倫敦收到久遲的信件之前，我不得不離開柏林，現在看來我可能必須在信件從柏林轉寄來之前離開蘇黎世。因此，我已經有好幾週沒有收到你的信了——自你寫到你的朋友的那封信以來，我急切想知道你在這段時間裡發生了什麼事情。"

      "I came to Switzerland the day before yesterday, pushed on by the urgency
      of affairs at home. Here we hold the last meeting of our international
      committee before I go back to Italy. This will be to-morrow (Friday)
      night, and according to present plans I set out for Rome on Saturday
      morning.

      "我前天來到瑞士，被國內事務的迫切性推動。在我回到義大利之前，我們在此地舉行我們國際委員會的最後一次會議。這將是明天（星期五）晚上，並且根據目前的計畫，我將在星期六早上出發前往羅馬。"

      buoyed up with hope; then my soul was furrowed by doubts, now it is braced

      "我的回來將與幾周前的逃離多麼的不同！那時我深陷於絕望，而現在我充滿了希望；那時我的靈魂被疑惑所犁耕，現在卻被確定性所支撐；過去我的想法只是一個夢想，現在卻成為了現實的實踐。"

      "O Roma, my Roma, it is a good thing to live. After all, the world is no
      Gethsemane, and when a man has a beautiful life like yours belonging to
      him he may be forgiven if he forgets the voices which assail him with
      fears. They have come to me sometimes, dearest, in this long and cruel
      silence, and I have asked myself hideous questions. What is happening to
      my dear one in the midst of my enemies? What sufferings are being
      inflicted upon her for my sake? She is brave, and will bear anything, but
      did I do right to leave her behind? Bruno died rather than betray me, and
      she will do more—infinitely more in her eyes—she will see <i>me</i> die,
      rather than imperil a cause which is a thousand times more dear to me than
      my life.

      "哦，我的羅馬，我的羅馬，生活多美好啊。畢竟，世界並非客西馬尼園，當一個人像你一樣擁有美好的生活，他可以被原諒，即使他忘記了那些給他帶來恐懼的聲音。它們有時會來到我身邊，在這漫長而殘酷的寂靜中，我問自己一些可怕的問題。我的親人在我的敵人中會發生什麼情況？她為我承受了什麼苦難？她很勇敢，可以承受任何事，但我是否應該把她留在後面呢？布魯諾選擇死亡而不背叛我，她會做出更大的犧牲——在她看來無比巨大的犧牲——她寧願看著我死，也不願讓一個比我生命重要一千倍的事業受到威脅。"

      "Addio, carissima! Set me as a seal upon thine heart, as a seal upon thine
      arm, for love is strong as death. If there were any possibility of our
      love increasing it <i>would</i> increase after going through dangers like
      these. Keep well, dearest. Preserve that sweet life which is so precious
      to me that I cannot live without it. Do you remember, it was the 2nd of
      February when we parted in the darkness at the church door, and now it is
      Easter, and the day after to-morrow we shall hear the Easter bells! Spring
      is here, and in the unchangeable changeableness of nature I see the
      resurrection of humanity and listen to the Gloria of God.
    </p>

      "再見，我最親愛的！使我像印記鎖在你的心上，就像印記鎖在你的手臂上，因為愛情就像死亡一樣堅強。如果我們的愛有可能增加，那麼在經歷這樣的危險後它會增加。保重身體，親愛的。保護那份甜美的生活，它對我來說如此珍貴，以至於我無法沒有它而生活。你還記得嗎，那是2月2日，我們在教堂門口的黑暗中分開，現在是復活節，明天我們將聽到復活節的鐘聲！春天來了，我在大自然的不變中看到人類的復活，並且聆聽到上帝的榮耀。"

      "You cannot answer this letter, dear, because I shall already be on the
      way to Rome before it reaches you, but you can send me a telegram to
      Chiasso. Do so. I shall look out for the telegraph boy the moment the
      train stops at the station. Say you are well and happy and waiting for me,
      and it will be like a smile from your lovely lips and eyes on the frontier
      of my native land.

      "親愛的，你無法回覆這封信，因為在它到達你手中之前，我已經在去羅馬的路上了，但你可以給我發一封到基亞索的電報。請這樣做。當火車在車站停下的那一刻，我就會去找電報小子。說你身體健康、幸福，並且在等待我，這將像是來自你可愛的嘴唇和眼睛的微笑在我祖國的邊境上。"

      "My train is due to arrive on Sunday morning at seven o'clock. Meet me at

      Roma had grown paler and paler as she read this letter. The man's love and
      trust were crushing her. Tears filled her eyes and flooded her face. But
      her soul, which had been stunned and had fallen, recovered itself and
      arose.

      羅馬讀著這封信，臉色越來越蒼白。這個男人的愛情和信任讓她難以承受。她的眼淚湧出，一股腦兒的劃過她的臉。但她震驚並跌倒的靈魂卻恢復了自我，並重新站起來。
