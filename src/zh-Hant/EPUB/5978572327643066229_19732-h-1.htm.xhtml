<p>"Tell me, I beg of you."</p><p>告訴我，我求你。</p>
<p>He was trying to look into her face again, and she was eluding his gaze
as before, but now for another, a sweeter reason.</p><p>他再次試圖看向她的臉，而她如之前一樣迴避他的目光，但現在的原因，卻是一種更甜蜜的理由。</p>
<p>"I thought if—if you would come to my house when my friends are there,
your presence as my guest, in the midst of those in whose eyes you have
injured me, might be sufficient of itself to wipe out everything.
But...."</p><p>我曾想，如果你能在我的朋友們在我家的時候來，你作為我客人的存在，在那些認為你傷害過我的人面前，可能會足夠抹去一切。但是...</p>
<p>"Is that <i>all?</i>" he said.</p><p>"就這樣嗎？"他說。</p>
<p>"Then you are not afraid?"</p><p>那麼，你不害怕嗎？</p>
<p>"Afraid?"</p><p>害怕？</p>
<p>For one moment they looked at each other, and their eyes were shining.</p><p>他們彼此對視了一剎那，他們的眼睛閃爍著光芒。</p>
<p>"I have thought of something else," she said.</p><p>「我想到了別的事情」她說。</p>
<p>"What is it?"</p><p>這是什麼？</p>
<p>"You have heard that I am a sculptor. I am making a fountain for the
Municipality, and if I might carve your face into it...."</p><p>你可能已經聽說我是個雕塑家。我正在為市政府製作一座噴泉，如果我可以將你的面孔雕刻在其中......</p>
<p>"It would be coals of fire on my head."</p><p>那將是我頭上的熾熱煤火。</p>
<p>"You would need to sit to me."</p><p>你需要坐在我旁邊。</p>
<p>"When shall it be?"</p><p>何時會是？</p>
<p>"To-morrow morning to begin with, if that is not too soon."</p><p>如果明早開始不會太早的話。</p>
<p>"It will be years on years till then," he said.</p><p>"那將是年復一年的時間，"他說。</p>
<p>She bent her head and blushed. He tried again to look at her beaming
eyes and golden complexion, and for sheer joy of being followed up she
turned her face away.</p><p>她低下頭並且臉紅了。他再次嘗試看她的熠熠眼眸和金色的臉色，而出於被追隨的純粹喜悅，她把臉轉過去了。</p>
<p>"Forgive me if I have stayed too long," she said, making a feint of
opening the door.</p><p>"如果我待得太久，請原諒我。"她說著，假裝要開門。</p>
<p>"I should have grudged every moment if you had gone sooner," he
answered.</p><p>"如果你早點走，我會對每一刻感到抱歉，"他回答。</p>
<p>"I only wished that you should not think of me with hatred and
bitterness."</p><p>我只希望你不要帶著仇恨和苦澀的心情來想我。</p>
<p>"If I ever had such a feeling it is gone."</p><p>如果我曾經有過這樣的感覺，它已經消逝。</p>
<p>"Mine has gone too," she said softly, and again she prepared to go.</p><p>「我的也已經去了。」她輕聲說，然後再次準備離開。</p>
<p>One hook of her cape had got entangled in the silk muslin at her
shoulder, and while trying to free it she looked at him, and her look
seemed to say, "Will you?" and his look replied, "May I?" and at the
physical touch a certain impalpable bridge seemed in an instant to cross
the space that had divided them.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00095" title="70"><a id="Page_70" title="70"></a></span></p><p>她披肩的一根鉤子卡在肩膀上的絲質紗布裡，她一邊試圖扣住披肩，一邊看著他。她的眼神似乎在詢問：“你能嗎？”他的眼神回答：“我可以嗎？”在他們肢體的接觸處，彷彿瞬間就有了一座橋樑，將他們之間的隔閡消除了。</p>
<p>"Let me see you to the door?" he said, and her eyes said openly, "Will
you?"</p><p>"讓我送你到門口?"他說，她的眼神中流露出明顯的"你願意嗎?"</p>
<p>They walked down the staircase side by side, going step by step, and
almost touching.</p><p>他們並肩走下樓梯，一步一步地走，幾乎觸碰到了。</p>
<p>"I forgot to give you my address—eighteen Trinità de' Monti," she said.</p><p>"我忘記告訴你我的地址了—十八號的特立尼塔德蒙蒂，"她說。</p>
<p>"Eighteen Trinità de' Monti," he repeated.</p><p>"他重複說，'十八，特立尼泰德蒙蒂。'"</p>
<p>They had reached the second storey. "I am trying to remember," she said.
"After all, I think I have seen you before somewhere."</p><p>他們已經到達了二樓。"我正在努力回憶，"她說。“畢竟，我想我在某處見過你。”</p>
<p>"In a dream, perhaps," he answered.</p><p>"也許在夢中，"他回答。</p>
<p>"Yes," she said. "Perhaps in the dream I spoke about."</p><p>"是的，"她說。"也許在我談到的那個夢中。"</p>
<p>They had reached the street, and Roma's carriage, a hired <i>coupé</i>, stood
waiting a few yards from the door.</p><p>他們已經抵達街頭，羅馬的馬車，一輛租來的雙馬車，就停在離門口幾碼遠的地方等待。</p>
<p>They shook hands, and at the electric touch she raised her head and gave
him in the darkness the look he had tried to take in the light.</p><p>他們握手，那電流般的觸感讓她抬起了頭，在黑暗中給了他那個他在光明中一直嘗試捕捉的眼神。</p>
<p>"Until to-morrow then," she said.</p><p>"那麼，明天見，"她說。</p>
<p>"To-morrow morning," he replied.</p><p>"他回答說，明天早上。"</p>
<p>"To-morrow morning," she repeated, and again in the eye-asking between
them she seemed to say, "Come early, will you not?—there is still so
much to say."</p><p>"明早"，她再次說道，又再次在他們之間的眼神交流中，彷彿在說，“你能早點來嗎？還有很多話要說。”</p>
<p>He looked at her with his shining eyes, and something of the boy came
back to his world-worn face as he closed the carriage door.</p><p>他用閃亮的雙眼看著她，當他關上馬車的門時，他那憔悴的臉上又浮現出一些少年時的模樣。</p>
<p>"Adieu!"</p><p>再見！</p>
<p>"Adieu!"</p><p>再見！</p>
<p>She drew up the window, and as the carriage moved away she smiled and
bowed through the glass.</p><p>她拉起窗戶，當馬車駛離的時候，她透過玻璃微笑並鞠躬。</p>

<h3 id="pgepubid00098">I</h3>
<p>The Piazza of Trinità de' Monti takes its name from a church and convent
which stand on the edge of the Pincian Hill.</p><p>"特里尼塔·德·蒙蒂廣場的名字來源於位於平西奧山邊緣的一座教堂和修道院。"</p>
<p>A flight of travertine steps, twisted and curved to mask the height,
goes down from the church to a diagonal piazza, the Piazza di Spagna,
which is always bright with the roses of flower-sellers, who build their
stalls around a fountain.</p><p>一段白色石灰岩臺階，蜿蜒曲折，以掩飾其高度，從教堂延伸至一個對角的廣場，即西班牙廣場。廣場上總是充滿了花賣們的玫瑰花的亮色，他們將攤位佈置在一個噴泉周圍。</p>
<p>At the top of these steps there stands a house, four-square to all
winds, and looking every way over Rome. The sun rises and sets on it,
the odour of the flowers comes up to it from the piazza, and the music
of the band comes down to it from the Pincio. Donna Roma occupied two
floors of this house. One floor, the lower one, built on arches and
entered from the side of the city, was used as a studio, the other was
as a private apartment.</p><p>在這些階梯的頂端，有一座四面八方都能看見風的房子，可以俯視整個羅馬。陽光在它上面升起與落下，花香從廣場上揚升到它那裡，樂隊的音樂從皮恩喬山上流下到它那裡。當納羅馬佔據了這房子的兩層樓。其中一層，較低的那一層，是建在拱門上的，從城市側面進入，被用作工作室，另一層則作為私人公寓。</p>
<p>Donna Roma's home consisted of ten or twelve rooms on the second floor,
opening chiefly out of a central drawing-room, which was furnished in
red and yellow damask, papered with velvet wall-papers, and lighted by
lamps of Venetian glass representing lilies in rose-colour and violet.
Her bedroom, which looked to the Quirinal, was like the nest of a bird
in its pale-blue satin, with its blue silk counterpane and its
embroidered cushion at the foot of the bed; and her boudoir, which
looked to the Vatican, was full of vases of malachite and the skins of
wild animals, and had a bronze clock on the chimney-piece set in a
statue of Mephistopheles. The only other occupant of her house, besides
her servants, was a distant kinswoman, called her aunt, and known to
familiars as the Countess Betsy; but in the studio below, which was
connected with the living rooms by a circular staircase, and hung round
with masks, busts, and weapons, there was Bruno Rocco, her
marble-pointer, the friend and housemate of David Rossi.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00099" title="72"><a id="Page_72" title="72"></a></span></p><p>頓娜·羅馬的家是位於二樓的十間或十二間房間，主要開在一個中央繪圖室，該繪圖室用紅色和黃色緞子佈置，用天鵝絨桌布墊砌，並由代表玫瑰色和紫羅蘭色百合的威尼斯玻璃燈照亮。她的臥室面對奎裡納爾宮，就像鳥巢一樣的淡藍色緞布，配有藍色絲質罩單和床腳繡花墊；她的化妝間面對梵蒂岡，裡面充滿了孔雀石花瓶和野生動物皮毛，並在壁爐上有個鍍銅鐘，鐘面鑲在美菲斯托費勒斯的雕像上。除了她的僕人之外，她家的唯一其他居民是一位遠親，被稱為她的姨媽，並以貝特西伯爵夫人的名字為熟人所知。但是在下面的工作室裡，該工作室透過一個圓形樓梯與起居室連線，並掛有面具，胸像和武器，布魯諾·羅科，她的大理石雕刻者，是大衛·羅西的朋友和房友。</p>
<p>On the morning after Donna Roma's visit to the Piazza Navona a letter
came from the Baron. He was sending Felice to be her servant. "The man
is a treasure and sees nothing," he wrote. And he added in a footnote:
"Don't look at the newspapers this morning, my child; and if any of them
send to you say nothing."</p><p>在多娜·羅馬訪問納沃納廣場的第二天早上，男爵寄來了一封信。他正在派費利切來作她的僕人。“這個人是個寶藏，他什麼都不看，"他寫道。他在腳註中又補充道：“親愛的，今天早上不要看報紙，如果有人給你傳送資訊，什麼也不要說。”</p>
<p>But Roma had scarcely finished her coffee and roll when a lady
journalist was announced. It was Lena, the rival of Olga both in
literature and love.</p><p>但是羅馬剛剛喝完咖啡、吃完麵包卷就有人宣佈有位女記者來訪。那是蓮娜，她在文學和愛情上都是歐爾加的競爭對手。</p>
<p>"I'm 'Penelope,'" she said. "'Penelope' of the <i>Day</i>, you know. Come to
see if you have anything to say in answer to the Deputy Rossi's speech
yesterday. Our editor is anxious to give you every opportunity; and if
you would like to reply through me to Olga's shameful libels.... Haven't
you seen her article? Here it is. Disgraceful insinuations. No lady
could allow them to pass unnoticed."</p><p>"我是'潘諾洛佩'"，她說，"'潘諾洛佩'的一天，你知道的。來看看你有沒有什麼要回應羅西副檢察官昨天的演講。我們的編輯非常願意給你所有的機會，如果你願意透過我回應奧爾加的恥辱性的誹謗……你沒有看到她的文章嗎？這就是。令人不齒的暗示。沒有一個淑女會允許它們不受到注意。"</p>
<p>"Nevertheless," said Roma, "that is what I intend to do. Good-morning!"</p><p>"不過，" 羅馬說, "這就是我打算做的。早安!"</p>
<p>Lena had barely crossed the doorstep when a more important person drove
up. This was the Senator Palomba, Mayor of Rome, a suave, oily man, with
little twinkling eyes.</p><p>莉娜剛剛踏出門檻，更重要的人物就駕到了。這人就是參議員帕隆巴，羅馬市長，一個滑溜溜、油腔滑調的男人，眼睛閃閃發光。</p>
<p>"Come to offer you my sympathy, my dear! Scandalous libels. Liberty of
the press, indeed! Disgraceful! It's in all the newspapers—I've brought
them with me. One journal actually points at you personally. See—'A
lady sculptor who has recently secured a commission from the
Municipality through the influence of a distinguished person.' Most
damaging, isn't it? The elections so near, too! We must publicly deny
the statement. Ah, don't be alarmed! Only way out of a nest of hornets.
Nothing like diplomacy, you know. Of course the Municipality will buy
your fountain just the same, but I thought I would come round and
explain before publishing anything."</p><p>"我來向你表示同情，親愛的！真是醜聞般的誹謗。新聞自由，真是太丟臉了！所有的報紙都有這個新聞--我都帶來了。有一家報紙甚至直接指名道姓的你。看--'一位女雕塑家最近透過一位傑出人物的影響力，獲得了市政府的委託。這個指控真是危害甚大，不是嗎？選舉也快到了！我們必須公開否認這個宣稱。啊，別擔心！躲避大難的唯一方法就是轉移視線。沒有什麼比外交更有用的了。當然市政府還會照常購買你的噴泉，但我覺得我應該在公開任何資訊之前先來解釋一下。"</p>
<p>Roma said nothing, and the great man backed himself out with the air of
one who had conferred a favour, but before going he had a favour to ask
in return.</p><p>羅馬沒有說話，那位偉大的人帶著施恩者的派頭退出了房間，但在離開之前，他有一個回報的請求要提。</p>
<p>"It's rumoured this morning, my dear, that the Government is about to
organise a system of secret police—and quite right, too. You remember
my nephew, Charles Minghelli? I brought him here when he came from
Paris. Well, Charles would like to be at the head of the new force. The
very man! Finds out everything that happens, from the fall of a pin to
an attempt at revolution, and if Donna Roma<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00100" title="73"><a id="Page_73" title="73"></a></span> will only say a word for
him.... Thanks!... What a beautiful bust! Yours, of course? A
masterpiece! Fit to put beside the masterpieces of old Rome."</p><p>"今天早上傳出的謠言，親愛的，政府即將組織一個秘密警察系統，這很對的。 你還記得我的侄子查理斯·閔赫利嗎？他從巴黎來時，我帶他來到這裡。好了，查理斯希望能成為新部隊的首領，他是個非常適合的人選！從一根針掉落到革命企圖，他都能發現，如果唐娜·羅瑪肯為他說句話就好了……謝謝！…真是個漂亮的胸像！當然是你的嗎？真是個傑作！可以與古羅馬的傑作並駕齊驅。"</p>
<p>The Mayor was not yet out of the drawing-room when a third visitor was
in the hall. It was Madame Sella, a fashionable modiste, with social
pretensions, who contrived to live on terms of quasi-intimacy with her
aristocratic customers.</p><p>市長還未走出會客室，第三位訪客就已在大廳裡。這位是賣拉夫人，一位有社交企圖心的時髦裁縫師，她設法與她的貴族顧客保持著半親密的關係。</p>
<p>"Trust I am not <i>de trop</i>! I knew you wouldn't mind my calling in the
morning. What a scandalous speech of that agitator yesterday! Everybody
is talking about it. In fact, people say you will go away. It isn't
true, is it? No? So glad! So relieved!... By the way, my dear, don't
trouble about those stupid bills of mine, but ... I'm giving a little
reception next week, and if the Baron would only condescend ... you'll
mention it? A thousand thanks! Good-morning!"</p><p>我希望我沒有打擾到你！我知道你不會介意我在早上來拜訪。昨天那個煽動者的演講真是醜聞纍纍！大家都在談論這件事。事實上，有人說你將會離開。這不是真的，對吧？不是？真高興！真放心！...順便提一下，親愛的，不用煩惱那些愚蠢的賬單，但是...我下週要舉辦一個小型接待，如果男爵願意屈尊...你會提到他嗎？非常感謝！早安！</p>
<p>"Count Mario," announced Felice, and an effeminate old dandy came
tripping into the room. He was Roma's landlord and the Italian
Ambassador at St. Petersburg.</p><p>"費利斯宣佈，'馬里奧伯爵'，一個娘娘腔的老花花公子蹦蹦跳跳地走進了房間。他是羅馬的房東，也是義大利駐聖彼得堡的大使。"</p>
<p>"So good of you to see me, Donna Roma. Such an uncanonical hour, too,
but I <i>do</i> hope the Baron will not be driven to resign office on account
of these malicious slanders. You think not? So pleased!"</p><p>你來看我真是太好了，羅馬女士。而且這個時間也太不守規矩了，但我真希望男爵不會因為這些惡意的誹謗而被迫辭職。你不這麼認為嗎？真是太高興了！</p>
<p>Then stepping to the window, "What a lovely view! The finest in Rome,
and that's the finest in Europe! I'm always saying if it wasn't Donna
Roma I should certainly turn out my tenant and come to live here
myself.... That reminds me of something. I'm ... well, I'm tired of
Petersburg, and I've written to the Minister asking to be transferred to
Paris, and if somebody will only whisper a word for me.... How sweet of
you! Adieu!"</p><p>然後走到窗邊，"真是美麗的景色！羅馬最美的，而那就是歐洲最美的！我總是在說，如果這裡不是多納羅馬，我一定會把我的租客趕出去，自己來這裡住……這讓我想起了一些東西。我……嗯，我對聖彼得堡感到厭倦，我已經寫信給部長，要求調到巴黎，如果有人願意為我說一句話……你真好！再見！"</p>
<p>Roma was sick of all this insincerity, and feeling bitter against the
person who had provoked it, when an unseen hand opened the door of a
room on the Pincio side of the drawing-room, and the testy voice of her
aunt called to her from within.</p><p>羅馬厭倦了所有的虛偽，對引起這一切的人感到憤怒，正在這時，一隻看不見的手開啟了繪畫室的皮恩錫奧側的一間房門，她的姑媽的暴躁聲音從裡面叫她。</p>
<p>The old lady, who had just finished her morning toilet and was redolent
of scented soap, reclined in a white robe on a bed-sofa with a gilded
mirror on one side of her and a little shrine on the other. Her bony
fingers were loaded with loose rings, and a rosary hung at her wrist. A
cat was sitting at her feet, with a gold cross suspended from its
ribbon.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00101" title="74"><a id="Page_74" title="74"></a></span></p><p>剛完成早晨梳洗，並散發香皂芬芳的老婦人，一身白色長袍在鑲金鏡子旁的床榻上休息，她的另一側則是個小神壇。她那瘦骨嶙峋的手指上戴著多件鬆鬆垮垮的戒指，手腕處掛著一串念珠。一隻貓正坐在她的腳旁，項圈上懸掛著一個金十字架。</p>
<p>"Ah, is it you at last? You come to me sometimes. Thanks!" she said in a
withering whimper. "I thought you might have looked in last night, and I
lay awake until after midnight."</p><p>"啊，終於是你來了嗎？你偶爾會來看我。謝謝！"她以幾乎聽不見的聲音說。"我以為你可能昨晚會過來，所以我一直醒著，一直到午夜之後。"</p>
<p>"I had a headache and went to bed," said Roma.</p><p>"我頭痛所以去睡覺了，" 羅馬說。</p>
<p>"I never have anything else, but nobody thinks of me," said the old
lady, and Roma went over to the window.</p><p>"我從來就只有這麼多，但無人顧念我，"老太太說著，羅馬走向了視窗。</p>
<p>"I suppose you are as headstrong as ever, and still intend to invite
that man in spite of all my protests?"</p><p>我猜你依然固執如故，儘管我一再抗議，你仍然打算邀請那個人？</p>
<p>"He is to sit to me this morning, and may be here at any time."</p><p>他今天早上要來找我，可能隨時都會到。</p>
<p>"Just so! It's no use speaking. I don't know what girls are coming to.
When I was young a man like that wouldn't have been allowed to cross the
threshold of any decent house in Rome. He would have been locked up in
prison instead of sitting for his bust to the ward of the Prime
Minister."</p><p>就是這樣！說話沒有用。我不知道現在的女孩子們會變成什麼樣。在我年輕的時候，像那樣的男人甚至不會被允許越過任何一個像樣的羅馬家庭的門檻。他應該被關在監獄裡，而不是坐在首相的保護區為他的半身像拍照。</p>
<p>"Aunt Betsy," said Roma, "I want to ask you a question."</p><p>"貝特西阿姨，" 羅馬說，"我想問你一個問題。"</p>
<p>"Be quick, then. My head is coming on as usual. Natalina! Where's
Natalina?"</p><p>那麼，快點。我頭又開始痛了。娜塔莉娜！娜塔莉娜在哪裡？</p>
<p>"Was there any quarrel between my father and his family before he left
home and became an exile?"</p><p>在我父親離家出走並成為流亡者之前，他和他的家人之間有沒有任何爭吵？</p>
<p>"Certainly not! Who said there was? Quarrel indeed! His father was
broken-hearted, and as for his mother, she closed the gate of the
palace, and it was never opened again to the day of her death. Natalina,
give me my smelling salts. And why haven't you brought the cushion for
the cat?"</p><p>當然沒有！誰說過有？爭吵根本就沒有！他的父親心碎了，他的母親封閉了宮殿的大門，從那天起直到她去世那天都再也沒有開啟過。娜塔麗娜，給我我的醒神鹽。你為什麼沒有給貓帶來坐墊？</p>
<p>"Still, a man has to live his own life, and if my father thought it
right...."</p><p>然而，一個人必須過自己的生活，如果我父親認為這是正確的...</p>
<p>"Right? Do you call it right to break up a family, and, being an only
son, to let a title be lost and estates go to the dogs?"</p><p>對嗎？你覺得破壞一個家庭，身為獨子卻讓爵位流失，資產敗落，這算是對的嗎？</p>
<p>"I thought they went to the Baron, auntie."</p><p>我以為他們去找男爵，阿姨。</p>
<p>"Roma, aren't you ashamed to sneer at me like that? At the Baron, too,
in spite of all his goodness! As for your father, I'm out of patience.
He wasted his wealth and his rank, and left his own flesh and blood to
the mercy of others—and all for what?"</p><p>"羅馬，你對我這樣嘲笑，難道你不覺得羞恥嗎？就算面對那位對你如此和藹的男爵，你也這麼做！至於你的父親，我已經失去了耐心。他浪費了他的財富和地位，把自己的親生骨肉留給了別人的憐憫——而這一切是為了什麼？"
</p>
<p>"For country, I suppose."</p><p>我想是為了國家吧。</p>
<p>"For fiddlesticks! For conceit and vanity and vainglory. Go away! My
head is fit to split. Natalina, why<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00102" title="75"><a id="Page_75" title="75"></a></span> haven't you given me my smelling
salts? And why will you always forget to...."</p><p>為了琴弦！為了自負和虛榮。走開！我頭都要裂開了。娜塔莉娜，為什麼你還沒給我我的鼻煙？為什麼你總是忘記要...</p>
<p>Roma left the room, but the voice of her aunt scolding the maid followed
her down to the studio.</p><p>羅馬離開了房間，但她阿姨責罵女僕的聲音卻追隨著她一直傳到工作室。</p>
<p>Her dog was below, and the black poodle received her with noisy
demonstrations, but the humorous voice which usually saluted her with a
cheery welcome she did not hear. Bruno was there, nevertheless, but
silent and morose, and bending over his work with a sulky face.</p><p>她的狗在下面，黑色的貴賓犬吵鬧地迎接她，但她卻沒有聽到那像往常以愉快的聲音歡迎她的風趣語調。布魯諾確實在那裡，但是沉默且憂鬱，帶著糾結的臉孤獨地工作著。</p>
<p>She had no difficulty in understanding the change when she looked at her
own work. It stood on an easel in a compartment of the studio shut off
by a glass partition, and was a head of David Rossi which she had
roughed out yesterday. Not yet feeling sure which of the twelve apostles
around the dish of her fountain was the subject that Rossi should sit
for, she had decided to experiment on a bust. It was only a sketch, but
it was stamped with the emotions that had tortured her, and it showed
her that unconsciously her choice had been made already. Her choice was
Judas.</p><p>她毫不費力地理解了變化，當她看到自己的作品時。她的作品放在畫室一個由玻璃隔間隔開的小隔間的畫架上，是她昨天粗略畫出的大衛·羅西的頭像。她還不確定羅西應該模仿噴泉盤子周圍的哪個使徒，因此她決定嘗試畫一個半身像。這只是一個草圖，但它充滿了折磨她的情感，並提醒她，其實她的選擇已無意識地做出了。她的選擇是猶大。</p>
<p>Last night she had laughed when looking at it, but this morning she saw
that it was cruel, impossible, and treacherous. A touch or two at the
clay obliterated the sinister expression, and, being unable to do more
until the arrival of her sitter, she sat down to write a letter.</p><p>昨晚她看到它時還笑了起來，但今天早上，她發現這是殘忍的，不可能的，又狡猾的。稍稍觸及泥土就可以抹去那種邪惡的表情，然後，在她的模特到來之前無法做更多的事情，她坐下來寫了一封信。</p>
<p style="padding-top:.5em">"<span class="smcap">My dear Baron</span>,—Thanks for Cardinal Felice. He will be a great comfort
in this household if only he can keep the peace with Monsignor Bruno,
and live in amity with the Archbishop of Porter's Lodge. Senator Tom-tit
has been here to suggest some astonishing arrangement about my fountain,
and to ask me to mention his nephew, Charles Minghelli, as a fit and
proper person to be chief of your new department of secret police.
Madame de Trop and Count Signorina have also been, but of their modest
messages more anon.</p><p style="padding-top:.5em">親愛的男爵，感謝你對費利切樞機的關照。只要他能與布魯諾樞機保持和平，並與波特的門房大主教和睦共處，在這個家庭中，他將是一個大大的安慰。參議員湯姆-提特來過這裡，對我的噴泉提出了一些令人驚訝的安排，並讓我提起他的侄子查里斯·明赫利，認為他是你們新的秘密警察部門的適當及合適的首領。德特羅夫夫人和西諾里那伯爵也來過，關於他們的謙遜訊息，我們稍後再談。</p>
<p>"As for D. R., my barometer is 'set fair,' but it is likely to be a
stormier time than I expected. Last night I decked myself in my best bib
and tucker, and, in defiance of all precedent, went down to his
apartment. But the strange thing was that, whereas I had gone to find
out all about <i>him</i>, I hadn't been ten minutes in his company before he
told all about <i>me</i>—about my father, at all events, and his life in
London. I believe he knew me in that connection<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00103" title="76"><a id="Page_76" title="76"></a></span> and expected to appeal
to my filial feelings. Did too, so strong is the force of nature, and
then and thereafter, and all night long, I was like somebody who had
been shaken in an earthquake and wanted to cry out and confess. It was
not until I remembered what my father had been—or rather hadn't—and
that he was no more to me than a name, representing exposure to the
cruellest fate a girl ever passed through, that I recovered from the
shock of D. R.'s dynamite.</p><p>對於D.R.，我的心情預測還算平靜，但可能比我預期的更為動盪。昨晚我穿上了我最好的衣服，並且無視一切先例，去他的公寓。但奇怪的是，我去的目的是瞭解他，但在跟他共處不到十分鐘的時間內，他把我以及我父親在倫敦的生活都告訴我了。我認為他是以此激發我的孝順情感。而且的確如此，這種大自然的力量如此強大，到那時，甚至一整夜，我就像是在地震中被搖晃的人，想要大喊並坦白。直到我回想起我父親過去是什麼——或者說不是什麼——他對我來說不過是一個名字，代表著我經歷過的最殘酷的命運，我才從D.R.的震撼中恢復過來。</p>
<p>"He has promised to sit to me for his bust, and is to come this
morning!—Affectionately, </p><p>他已承諾讓我為他塑造半身像，而且今早會來！— 深情的，

<p style="text-align:right; margin-top:-1em;"><span class="smcap">Roma</span>.</p><p style="text-align:right; margin-top:-1em;">羅馬</p>
<p style="padding-bottom:.5em">"P. S.—My gentleman has good features, fine eyes, and a wonderful
voice, and though I truly believe he trembles at the sight of a woman
and has never been in love in his life, he has an astonishing way of
getting at one. But I could laugh to think how little execution his
fusillade will make in this direction."</p><p style="padding-bottom:.5em">附言—我的紳士有著出色的面部特徵，美麗的眼睛，和美妙的聲音。儘管我真心相信他看到女人就會顫抖，而且他一生中從未真正地愛過，但他卻有一種令人驚奇的方式來吸引人。然而，我卻會因為他的猛烈攻勢在這方面會導致多麼微弱的效果而發笑。</p>
<p>"Honourable Rossi!" said Felice's sepulchral voice behind her, and at
that moment David Rossi stepped into the studio.</p><p>"尊敬的羅西先生！"菲利斯的聲音從她身後響起，就在那一刻，大衛·羅西走進了工作室。</p>
<h3 id="pgepubid00104">II</h3>
<p>In spite of her protestations, Roma was nervous and confused. Putting
David Rossi to sit in the arm-chair on the platform for sitters, she
rattled on about everything—her clay, her tools, her sponge, and the
water they had forgotten to change for her. He must not mind if she
stared at him—that wasn't nice, but it was necessary—and he must
promise not to look at her work while it was unfinished—children and
fools, you know—the proverb was musty.</p><p>儘管羅馬反抗，但她還是感到緊張和困惑。她讓大衛·羅西坐在為雕像擺姿勢的高臺上的扶手椅中，她絡繹不絕地講述著所有的事情－她的土壤，她的工具，她的海綿，以及他們忘記替她換掉的水。如果她盯著他看，他一定不要介意－這樣做並不友好，但這是必需的－而且他必須答應在她的作品未完成的時候不看她的作品－你知道，孩子和傻子，這句諺語是陳腐的。</p>
<p>And while she talked she told herself that Thomas was the apostle he
must stand for. These anarchists were all doubters, and the chief of
doubters was the figure that would represent them.</p><p>當她談話的時候，她告訴自己湯瑪斯必須代表的就是使徒。這些無政府主義者都是懷疑者，而其中最主要的懷疑者將是代表他們的人物。</p>
<p>David Rossi did not speak much at first, and he did not join in Roma's
nervous laughter. Sometimes he looked at her with a steadfast gaze,
which would have been disconcerting if it had not been so simple and
childlike. At length he looked out of the window to where the city lay
basking in<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00105" title="77"><a id="Page_77" title="77"></a></span> the sunshine, and birds were swirling in the clear blue sky,
and began to talk of serious subjects.</p><p>最初，大衛·羅西並不怎麼說話，也並未參與羅馬的緊張笑聲。有時候，他用堅定的目光看著她，那種目光如果不是如此純真和孩子氣，可能會令人不安。最後，他看向窗外，城市在陽光下曬得悠閒，鳥兒在清澈的藍天中盤旋，他開始談論嚴肅的話題。</p>
<p>"How beautiful!" he said. "No wonder the English and Americans who come
to Italy for health and the pleasure of art think it a paradise where
every one should be content. And yet...."</p><p>"多麼美麗啊！"他說，"難怪來自英國和美國的人為了健康和藝術的愉悅而來到義大利，他們認為這裡是每個人都應該感到滿足的天堂。然而...."</p>
<p>"Yes?"</p><p>是的？</p>
<p>"Under the smile of this God-blessed land there is suffering such as can
hardly be found in any other country of the world. Sometimes I think I
cannot bear it any longer, and must go away, as others do."</p><p>在這塊上帝賜福的土地的笑容之下，卻有著幾乎在世界上任何其他國家都無法找到的痛苦。有時候，我覺得我再也無法忍受，正如其他人一樣，我必須走開。</p>
<p>"A little more this way, please—thank you! That doesn't do much for
them, does it?"</p><p>請稍微往這邊一點，謝謝！那對他們來說並沒有太大幫助，對吧？</p>
<p>"For them? No! God comfort the poor exiles—their path is a bridge of
sighs! Poor, friendless, forgotten, huddled together in some dingy
quarter of a foreign city, one a music-master, another a teacher of
languages, a third a supernumerary at a theatre, a fourth an organ-man
or even a beggar in the streets, yet weapons in the hand of God and
shaking the thrones of the world!"</p><p>對他們來說？不！願神安慰那些可憐的流亡者－－他們的道路就像一座嘆息之橋！貧窮，無依無靠，被遺忘，聚集在外國城市的一個骯髒角落，一個是音樂老師，另一個是語言教師，還有一個是劇院的臨時演員，另一個是風琴手，甚至有乞丐在街頭，然而他們是神手中的武器，搖撼世界的王座！</p>
<p>"<i>You</i> have seen something of that, haven't you?"</p><p>你已經看到那個了，對吧？</p>
<p>"I have."</p><p>我有。</p>
<p>"In London?"</p><p>在倫敦嗎？</p>
<p>"Yes. There's an old quarter on the fringe of the fashionable district.
It is called Soho. Densely populated, infested with vice, the very sewer
of the city, yet an asylum of liberty for all that. The refugees of
Europe fly to it. Its criminals, too, perhaps; for misery, like poverty,
has many bedfellows."</p><p>對。在時尚區的邊緣有一個舊區。它被稱為蘇豪。這裡人口稠密，罪惡橫行，宛如城市的汙水池，但對此無悔的自由之地。歐洲的難民都會飛抵這裡。也許，這裡的罪犯也一樣；因為苦難，就像貧窮一樣，擁有許多睡伴。</p>
<p>"You lived there?"</p><p>你住在那裡嗎？</p>
<p>"Yes."</p><p>是</p>
<p>Roma was wiping her fingers with the sponge, and looking sideways out of
the window. "And your old friend, Doctor Roselli—he lived in Soho?"</p><p>"羅馬正在用海綿擦拭她的手指，同時斜睜著眼睛望向窗外。"你的老朋友，羅塞利醫生——他住在蘇豪區嗎？"</p>
<p>"In Soho Square when I knew him first. The house faced to the north, and
had a porch and trees in front of it."</p><p>當我初次認識他時，是在蘇豪廣場。那棟房子面向北方，門前有一個門廊和一些樹。</p>
<p>The sponge had dropped to the floor, but Roma did not observe it. She
took up a tooth-tool and began to work on the clay again.</p><p>海綿已經掉到地板上，但羅馬並沒有注意到。她拿起牙齒工具，再次開始在黏土上工作。</p>
<p>"A little more that way, please—thanks! Do you think your friend had a
right to renounce his rank and to break up his family in Italy? Think of
his father—he would be broken-hearted."<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00106" title="78"><a id="Page_78" title="78"></a></span></p><p>"再往那邊多一點，謝謝你！你覺得你的朋友有權放棄他在義大利的身份，並分裂他的家庭嗎？想想他的父親——那會讓他心碎的。"</p>
<p>"He was—I've heard my old friend say so. He cursed him at last and
forbade him to call himself his son."</p><p>他是的——我聽我的老朋友這麼說過。他最後詛咒了他，並禁止他自稱為他的兒子。</p>
<p>"There!"</p><p>在那裡!</p>
<p>"But he would never hear a word against the old man. 'He's my
father—that's enough,' he would say."</p><p>"但他永遠不會聽任何人誹謗那位老人。他會說，'他是我的父親 - 這就足夠了。'"</p>
<p>The tooth-tool, like the sponge, dropped out of Roma's fingers.</p><p>像海綿一樣，牙齒工具從羅馬的手指滑落下來。</p>
<p>"How stupid! But his mother...."</p><p>多麼愚蠢！但是他的母親....</p>
<p>"That was sadder still. In the early years of his exile she would pray
him to come home. 'You are the best of mothers,' he would answer, 'but I
cannot do so.'"</p><p>那更是悲慘。在他流亡的初期，她曾祈求他回家。他回答說：“你是最好的母親，但我無法這樣做。”</p>
<p>"He never saw her again?"</p><p>他再也沒有見過她？</p>
<p>"Never, but he worshipped her very name and she was a tower of strength
to him. 'Mothers!' he used to say, 'if you only knew your power! God be
merciful to the wayward one who has no mother!'"</p><p>他從未停止過對她名字的崇拜，她對他而言是無比的力量。他常常說："母親們啊，如果你們知道你們的力量有多大就好了！願上帝憐憫那些沒有母親的迷途之人。"</p>
<p>Roma's throat was throbbing. "He ... he was married?"</p><p>羅馬的喉嚨跳動著。"他...他已經結婚了嗎?"</p>
<p>"Yes. His wife was an Englishwoman, almost as friendless as himself."</p><p>是的。他的妻子是一名英國女性，幾乎和他一樣無依無靠。</p>
<p>"Eyes the other way, at the window—thank you!... Did she know who he
was?"</p><p>朝窗戶看的另一方向——謝謝你！...她知道他是誰嗎？</p>
<p>"Nobody knew. He was only a poor Italian doctor to all of us in Soho."</p><p>沒有人知道。對我們蘇豪區的所有人來說，他只是一個貧窮的義大利醫生。</p>
<p>"They ... they were ... happy?"</p><p>他們...他們是...快樂的？</p>
<p>"As happy as love and friendship could make them. And even when poverty
came...."</p><p>就像愛情與友誼能使他們感到的快樂一樣。即使貧窮來臨……</p>
<p>"He became poor—very poor?"</p><p>他變得很窮——非常窮。</p>
<p>"Very! It got known that Doctor Roselli was a revolutionary, and then
his English patients began to be afraid. The house in Soho Square had to
be given up at last, and we went into a side street. Only two rooms now,
one to the front, the other to the back, and four of us to live in them,
but the misery of that woman's outward circumstances never dimmed the
radiance of her sunny soul."</p><p>非常！大家得知羅塞利醫生是一個革命家，然後他的英國病人開始感到害怕。我們最後不得不放棄蘇活廣場的房子，轉進一條側街。現在只有兩間房間，一間面向前方，另一間面向後方，我們四個人要住在這裡，但這個女人的外在環境的悲慘情況從未使她陽光般的靈魂失去光芒。</p>
<p>Roma's bosom was heaving and her voice was growing thick. "She ...
died?"</p><p>羅馬的胸腔劇烈起伏，她的聲音越來越嘶啞。「她...死了？」</p>
<p>David Rossi bent his head and spoke in short, jerky sentences. "Her
death came at the bitterest moment of want. It was Christmas time. Very
cold and raw. We hadn't too much at home to keep us warm. She caught a
cold and it settled on her chest. Pneumonia! Only three or four days
altogether. She lay in the back room; it was<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00107" title="79"><a id="Page_79" title="79"></a></span> quieter. The doctor nursed
her constantly. How she fought for life! She was thinking of her little
daughter. Just six years of age at that time, and playing with her doll
on the floor."</p><p>大衛·羅西低下頭，以短促且顫抖的句子說話。「她在最傷心的時刻離世。那是聖誕節的時候。天氣非常寒冷和濕冷。我們家裡沒有太多東西來保暖。她感冒了，然後感冒便轉移到了她的胸部。肺炎！總共只有三到四天。她躺在後面的房間；那裡比較安靜。醫生一直在照料她。她如何奮鬥求生！她在想她的小女兒。當時只有六歲，正在地板上玩她的娃娃。」</p>
<p>His voice had enough to do to control itself.</p><p>他的聲音已經努力控制自己了。</p>
<p>"When it was all over we went into the front room and made our beds on a
blanket spread out on the bare boards. Only three of us now—the child
with her father, weeping for the mother lying cold the other side of the
wall."</p><p>當一切結束後，我們走進前廳，在赤裸的地板上鋪開毯子鋪了我們的床。現在只剩下我們三個人 — 小孩和他的父親，在牆的另一邊為冷冰冰的母親哭泣。</p>
<p>His eyes were still looking out at the window. In Roma's eyes the tears
were gathering.</p><p>他的眼睛仍然望向窗外。在羅馬的眼中，淚水正在聚集。</p>
<p>"We were nearly penniless, but our good angel was buried somehow. Oh,
the poor are the richest people in the world! I love them! I love them!"</p><p>我們幾乎一文不名，但我們的守護神卻不知為何消失了。噢，世界上最富有的人是窮人！我愛他們！我愛他們！</p>
<p>Roma could not look at him any longer.</p><p>羅馬再也無法看他了。</p>
<p>"It was in the cemetery of Kensal Green. There was a London fog and the
grave-diggers worked by torches, which smoked in the thick air. But the
doctor stood all the time with his head uncovered. The child was there
too, and driving home she looked out of the window and sometimes laughed
at the sights in the streets. Only six—and she had never been in a
coach before!"</p><p>那是在肯薩爾綠色的墓地裡。當時倫敦籠罩在大霧之中，墓地工人只能藉助煙霧繚繞的火炬來工作。但醫生始終赤著頭站在那裡。孩子也在場，回家的路上她從車窗向外看，偶爾對街上的景象咯咯地笑。只有六歲—她以前從來沒有坐過馬車！</p>
<p>At that moment was heard the boom of the gun that is fired from the
Castle of St. Angelo at mid-day, and Roma put down her tools.</p><p>就在那一刻，人們聽到了中午時分從聖安傑洛城堡發出的炮聲，而羅馬放下了她的工具。</p>
<p>"If you don't mind, I'll not try to do any more to-day," she said in a
husky voice. "Somehow it isn't coming right this morning. It's like that
sometimes. But if you can come at this time to-morrow...."</p><p>"如果你不介意，我今天就不再努力了，"她以沙啞的聲音說。"不知怎的，今天早上事情似乎都不對勁。有些時候就是這樣。但是如果你明天這個時候能過來...."</p>
<p>"With pleasure," said David Rossi, and a moment later he was gone.</p><p>"非常樂意，" 大衛·羅西說，然後他瞬間消失了。</p>
<p>She looked at her work and obliterated the expression again.</p><p>她看著自己的作品，再次抹去了那種表情。</p>
<p>"Not Thomas," she thought. "John—the beloved disciple! That would fit
him exactly."</p><p>「不是多馬，」她想。「應該是約翰──那鍾愛的門徒！這完全符合他。」</p>
<p>As she went upstairs to dress for lunch, Felice gave her an envelope
bearing the seal of the Prime Minister, and told her the dog was
missing.</p><p>當她上樓去換衣服準備午餐時，費麗絲給了她一個帶有總理印章的信封，並告訴她狗不見了。</p>
<p>"He must have followed Mr. Rossi," said Roma, and without ado she read
the letter.</p><p>"他一定是跟著羅西先生走的，" 羅馬說，然後她毫不猶豫地讀了那封信。</p>
<p style="padding-top:.5em">"<span class="smcap">Dear Roma</span>,—A thousand thanks for suggesting Charles Minghelli. I sent
for him, saw him, and appointed<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="80"><a id="Page_80" title="80"></a></span> him immediately. Thanks, too, for the

<p>Next morning Roma found herself dressing with extraordinary care.</p><p>隔天早晨，羅馬發現自己格外講究地打扮。</p>
<p>After coffee she went into the Countess's room as usual. The old lady
had made her toilette, and her cat was purring on a cushion by her side.</p><p>咖啡之後，她像往常一樣進入了伯爵夫人的房間。老夫人已經做好了梳洗，她的貓正在她身邊的坐墊上發出呼嚕聲。</p>
<p>"Aunt Betsy, is it true that my father was decoyed back to Italy by the
police?"</p><p>貝特西阿姨，我的父親真的是被警察誘騙回義大利的嗎？</p>
<p>"How do I know that? But if he was, it was no more than he might have
expected. He had been breeding sedition at the safe distance of a
thousand miles, and it was time he was brought to justice. Besides...."</p><p>我怎會知道那個呢？但如果真的如此，那也不過是他本該預料到的。他一直在千里之外醞釀分裂，現在該是他接受司法制裁的時候了。除此之外……</p>
<p>"Well?"</p><p>好嗎？</p>
<p>"There were the estates, and naturally the law could not assign them to
anybody else while there was no judgment against your father."</p><p>那裡有那些莊園，當然，在沒有對你父親的判決時，法律不能將它們劃歸其他人。</p>
<p>"So my father was enticed back to Italy in the interests of the next of
kin."</p><p>因此，出於對下一代親人的利益，我父親被誘使回到了義大利。</p>
<p>"Roma! How dare you talk like that? About your best friend, too!"</p><p>羅馬！你怎敢這樣說話？還是對你最好的朋友！</p>
<p>"I didn't say anything against the Baron, did I?"</p><p>我沒有說任何反對男爵的話，對吧？</p>
<p>"You would be an ungrateful girl if you did. As for your father, I'm
tired of talking. Only for his exile you would have had possession of
your family estates at this moment, and been a princess in your own
right."</p><p>如果你那麼做，你就是一個忘恩負義的女孩。至於你的父親，我已經厭倦了談論他。如果不是因為他被流放，你現在就已經擁有自己的家族財產，並且是自己的公主。</p>
<p>"Only for this exile I shouldn't have been here at all, auntie, and
somebody else would have been the princess, it seems to me."</p><p>"如果不是因為這次的流放，阿姨，我根本就不該在這裡，似乎應該有別人成為公主的。"</p>
<p>The old lady dropped the perfumed handkerchief that was at her nose and
said:</p><p>那位老太太從鼻子上掉下了香味的手帕，然後說：</p>
<p>"What do you talk about downstairs all day long, miss? Pretty thing if
you allow a man like that to fill you with his fictions. He is a nice
person to take your opinions from, and you are a nice girl to stand up
for a man who sold you into slavery, as I might say! Have you forgotten
the baker's<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00109" title="81"><a id="Page_81" title="81"></a></span> shop in London—or was it a pastry cook's, or what?—where
they made you a drudge and a scullery-maid, after your father had given
you away?"</p><p>"妳在樓下整天都在談些什麼，小姐？如果你讓那種人用他的虛構故事填滿你的頭腦，那真是件好事。他真是個適合你們從他那裡得到觀點的好人，你也是個勇於為一個將你賣為奴隸的人站起來的好女孩，我可以這麼說！你已經忘了倫敦的那家麵包店了嗎？還是甜點店還是什麼的？在你的父親把你送走之後，他們讓你成為了一個做苦力和洗碗工。"</p>
<p>"Don't speak so loud, Aunt Betsy."</p><p>"不要說得這麼大聲，貝蒂姑媽。"</p>
<p>"Then don't worry me by defending such conduct. Ah, how my head aches!
Natalina, where are my smelling salts? Natalina!"</p><p>那就別為這種行為辯護來煩我。啊，我的頭痛得厲害！娜塔莉娜，我的嗅鹽在哪裡？娜塔莉娜！</p>
<p>"I'm not defending my father, but still...."</p><p>我並非在為我父親辯護，可是……</p>
<p>"Should think not, indeed! If it hadn't been for the Baron, who went in
search of you, and found you after you had run away and been forced to
go back to your slave-master, and then sent you to school in Paris, and
now permits you to enjoy half the revenue of your father's estates, and
forbids us to say a word about his generosity, where would you be?

consigned you!"</p><p>“哪有這種事！如果不是男爵去找你，當你逃走，被迫返回到你的奴役主人身邊後找到你，然後把你送去巴黎的學校，現在讓你享受你父親的財產的一半的收入，並禁止我們提及他的慷慨，你現在會在哪裡？哎呀，我的聖母！也許在倫敦的街頭，你的父親把你送到那裡！”</p>
<p>The Princess Bellini was waiting for Roma when she returned to the

occurred.</p><p>貝利尼公主在畫廊等待羅馬回來。這位小女士表現得就如平時一樣友善，好像什麼特別的事情都沒發生過。</p>

<p>The little lady tapped Roma's arm with her pince-nez and laughed.</p><p>小女士用她的石英眼鏡輕拍羅馬的手臂，並笑了出來。</p>
<p>"Everybody has heard that <i>he</i> is sitting to you, and everybody

Samson...."</p><p>每個人都聽說他在你那兒坐著，每個人都明白。這讓我想起來，我明晚在新的歌劇院有一個包廂："參孫"在 Costanzi，你知道的。只有 Gi-gi 和我，但是如果你願意，我可以帶你去，並邀請你特別的"參孫"....</p>
<p>"Honourable Rossi," said Felice at the door, and David Rossi entered the
room, with the black poodle bounding before him.</p><p>"尊敬的羅西先生,"費利斯在門口說，大衛·羅西走進了房間，黑色的貴賓犬在他前面蹦跳。</p>

<p>"Black has quite deserted me since Mr. Rossi appeared," said Roma, and
then she introduced the deputy to the Princess.</p><p>"自從羅西先生出現後，小黑就完全拋棄了我，"羅馬說，然後她把副手介紹給公主。</p>
<p>The little lady was effusive. "I was just saying, Honourable Rossi, that
if you would honour my box at the opera to-morrow night...."</p><p>那位小女士非常熱情地說道："我剛剛在說，羅西先生，如果您能光臨我明晚的歌劇院包廂......"</p>
<p>David Rossi glanced at Roma.</p><p>大衛·羅斯蒂瞥了一眼羅馬。</p>
<p>"Oh yes, Donna Roma is coming, and if you will...."</p><p>哦，是的，唐娜·羅馬正在來，如果你願意的話....</p>
<p>"With pleasure, Princess."<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00110" title="82"><a id="Page_82" title="82"></a></span></p><p>樂意效勞，公主。</p>

Good-day!" said the Princess, and then in a low voice at the door, "I
leave you to your delightful duties, my dear. You are not looking so
well, though. Must be the scirocco. My poor dear husband used to suffer
from it shockingly. Adieu!"</p><p>"真是迷人！歌劇結束後，我們將在大飯店用餐。再見!"公主說，並在門口低聲說，"我把你留給你的美好職責，親愛的。但是，你看起來不是那麼好。可能是西羅科風的影響。我可憐的丈夫過去常常因此受苦。再見！"</p>
<p>Roma was less confused but just as nervous when she settled to her work
afresh.</p><p>當羅馬重新投入工作時，她的困惑稍減，但緊張程度仍舊一樣。</p>
<p>"I've been thinking all night long of the story you told me yesterday,"
she said. "No, that way, please—eyes as before—thank you! About your
old friend, I mean. He was a good man—I don't doubt that—but he made
everybody suffer. Not only his father and mother, but his wife also. Has
anybody a right to sacrifice his flesh and blood to a work for the
world?"</p><p>"我整夜都在想你昨天告訴我的那個故事，"她說。 "不，請像之前那樣看著我——謝謝你！我指的是你的老朋友。他是個好人——我毫不懷疑——但他讓每個人都遭受痛苦。不僅是他的父母，還有他的妻子。有誰有權為了世界的工作犧牲他的血肉親人呢？"</p>
<p>"When a man has taken up a mission for humanity his kindred must
reconcile themselves to that," said Rossi.</p><p>"當一個人為了人類接受了使命，他的親人必須接受這一點。"羅西說。</p>
<p>"Yes, but a child, one who cannot be consulted. Your friend's daughter,
for example. She was to lose everything—her father himself at last. How
could he love her? I suppose you would say he did love her."</p><p>"是的，但這孩子還無法進行諮詢。比如說，你朋友的女兒。她將失去一切，最後連她的父親也會失去。他怎麼能愛她？我猜你會說他確實愛她。"</p>
<p>"Love her? He lived for her. She was everything on earth to him, except
the one thing to which he had dedicated his life."</p><p>愛她？他是為她而活。她是他生活中的一切，除了他一生奉獻的那件事情以外。</p>
<p>A half-smile parted her lovely lips.</p><p>一個半笑掛在她的美麗嘴唇上。</p>
<p>"When her mother was gone he was like a miser who had been robbed of all
his jewels but one, and the love of father, mother, and wife seemed to
gather itself up in the child."</p><p>當她的母親離世後，他就像一個被搶走了所有珠寶只剩下一顆的吝嗇鬼，父母和妻子的愛似乎全部聚集在這個孩子身上。</p>
<p>The lovely lips had a doubtful curve.</p><p>那迷人的嘴唇呈現出疑慮的弧度。</p>
<p>"How bright she was, too! I can see her still in the dingy London house
with her violet eyes and coal-black hair and happy ways—a gleam of the
sun from our sunny Italy."</p><p>她真是光彩照人！我仍能看見她在昏暗的倫敦房子裡，有著紫羅蘭般的眼睛，煤黑的頭髮和快樂的舉止，像我們陽光明媚的義大利的一縷陽光。</p>
<p>She looked at him. His face was calm and solemn. Did he really know her
after all? She felt her cheeks flush and tingle.</p><p>她看著他。他的臉上寧靜而莊嚴。他真的認識她嗎？她的臉頰感到熱烈且微微麻木。</p>
<p>"And yet he left her behind to come to Italy on a hopeless errand," she
said.</p><p>"他竟然把她留下，跑到義大利去執行一項沒有希望的任務," 她說。</p>
<p>"He did."</p><p>他做了。</p>
<p>"How could he know what would happen?"</p><p>他怎麼可能知道會發生什麼事？</p>
<p>"He couldn't, and that troubled him most of all. He lived in constant
fear of being taken away from his daughter<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00111" title="83"><a id="Page_83" title="83"></a></span> before her little mind was
stamped with the sense of how much he loved her. Delicious selfishness!
Yet it was not altogether selfish. The world was uncharitable and cruel,
and in the rough chance of life it might even happen that she would be
led to believe that because her father gave her away, and left her, he
did not love her."</p><p>他無法做到，這讓他最為困擾。他生活在不斷的恐懼中，害怕在他的愛意能牢牢印記在他女兒純真的腦海中之前就被帶走。何等的美味的自私！然而，這並非完全的自私。世界是冷漠而殘暴的，而且在生活的艱難處境中，她甚至可能會被誤導相信，因為她的父親把她讓走，並離開她，他就不愛她。</p>
<p>Roma looked up again. His face was still calm and solemn.</p><p>羅馬再次抬頭看。他的臉依然保持冷靜和嚴肅。</p>
<p>"He gave her away, you say?"</p><p>"你說他把她送人了？"</p>
<p>"Yes. When the treacherous letter came from Italy he could not resist
it. It was like a cry from the buried-alive calling upon him to break
down the door of their tomb. But what could he do with the child? To
take her with him was impossible. A neighbour came—a
fellow-countryman—he kept a baker's shop in the Italian quarter. 'I'm
only a poor man,' he said, 'but I've got a little daughter of the same
age as yours, and two sticks will burn better than one. Give the child
to me and do as your heart bids you!' It was like a light from heaven.
He saw his way at last."</p><p>"是的。當那封背叛的信件從義大利來時，他無法抵擋住它。這就像埋葬活人的哭喊，呼籲他打破他們的墳墓之門。但他能拿這孩子怎麼辦？帶她與他一同去是不可能的。一位鄰居來了-一位鄉親-他在義大利區經營一家麵包店。他說，'我只是一個窮人，但我有一個和你女兒同齡的小女兒，兩根棒子燃燒起來比一根更好。把孩子交給我，隨你的心去做吧!'這就像來自天堂的一道光。他終於看到了出路。"</p>
<p>Roma listened with head aside.</p><p>羅馬側著頭聆聽。</p>
<p>"One day he took the child and washed her pretty face and combed her
glossy hair, telling her she was going to see another little girl and
would play with her always. And the child was in high glee and laughed
and chattered and knew no difference. It was evening when we set out for
the stranger's house, and in the twilight of the little streets
happy-hearted mothers were calling to their children to come in to go to
bed. The doctor sent me into a shop to buy a cake for the little one,
and she ate it as she ran and skipped by her father's side."</p><p>"有一天，他帶著孩子，洗淨了她可愛的小臉，梳理了她亮麗的秀髮，告訴她她即將去見另一個小女孩，並且會時常和她一起玩耍。小孩樂得合不攏嘴，嘻嘻哈哈，滿不在乎。當我們在傍晚動身前往陌生人家時，在小街道的黃昏裡，那些心情愉快的母親們正在呼喚他們的孩子回家睡覺。醫生讓我到商店裡買個蛋糕給小孩子，她一邊跑一邊跳，還一邊吃著父親為她買的蛋糕。"</p>
<p>Roma was holding her breath.</p><p>羅馬在屏住呼吸。</p>
<p>"The baker's shop was poor but clean, and his own little girl was
playing on the hearthrug with her cups and saucers. And before we were
aware of it two little tongues were cackling and gobbling together, and
the little back-parlour was rippling over with a merry twitter. The
doctor stood and looked down at the children, and his eyes shone with a
glassy light. 'You are very good, sir,' he said, 'but she is good too,
and she'll be a great comfort and joy to you always.' And the man said,
'She'll be as right as a trivet, doctor, and you'll be right too—you'll
be made triumvir like Mazzini, when the republic is proclaimed, and then
you'll send for the child, and for me too, I daresay.' But I could see<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00112" title="84"><a id="Page_84" title="84"></a></span>
that the doctor was not listening. 'Let us slip away now,' I said, and
we stole out somehow."</p><p>這家麵包店雖然貧窮但乾淨，麵包師傅的小女兒正在爐邊的地毯上用她的杯子和碟子玩耍。在我們意識到之前，兩個小舌頭已經在喳喳地訴說著，整個小客廳都充滿了歡快的嘰嘰喳喳聲。醫生站在那裡看著這些孩子，他的眼睛閃著玻璃般的光。他說，'你真好，先生，但她也很好，她將永遠給您帶來安慰和喜悅。'那男人說，'她會像固定的三腳架一樣的好，醫生，你也會好的——當共和國宣告時，你將像馬祖尼(Mazzini)一樣成為三頭統治者，然後你會叫這個孩子，也會叫我，我敢說。'但我看到醫生並沒有在聽。 '我們現在溜走吧，'我說，然後我們不知怎麼的就偷偷溜走了。</p>
<p>Roma's eyes were moistening, and the little tool was trembling in her
hand.</p><p>羅馬的眼眸中湧起淚水，小工具在她的手中微微顫動。</p>
<p>There was silence for some moments, and then from without, muffled by
the walls it passed through, there came the sound of voices. The nuns
and children of Trinità de' Monti were singing their Benediction—<i>Ora
pro nobis!</i></p><p>幾分鐘的寂靜過後，由遠處傳來了聲音，經過牆壁的阻隔聲音有些微弱。特里尼塔德蒙提的修女和孩子們正在唱他們的祝福語——為我們祈禱！</p>
<p>"I don't think I'll do any more to-day," said Roma. "The light is
failing me, and my eyes...."</p><p>"我不認為我今天會再做了，" 羅馬說。"光線變暗了，我的眼睛...."</p>
<p>"The day after to-morrow, then," said Rossi, rising.</p><p>"那就後天吧，" 羅西說著，然後站了起來。</p>
<p>"But do you really wish to go to the opera to-morrow night?"</p><p>但你真的希望明晚去看歌劇嗎？</p>
<p>He looked steadfastly into her face and answered "Yes."</p><p>他堅定地看著她的臉，回答說"是的。"</p>
<p>She understood him perfectly. He had sinned against her and he meant to
atone. She could not trust herself to look at him, so she took the damp
cloth and turned to cover up the clay. When she turned back he was gone.</p><p>她完全理解他。他對她犯了錯，他打算去贖罪。她不敢去看他，於是她拿起濕布，轉過身去掩蓋陶泥。當她再轉回來時，他已經不見了。</p>
<p>After dinner she replied to the Baron's letter of the day before.</p><p>晚餐後，她回覆了男爵前一天的信。</p>
<p style="padding-top:.5em">"<span class="smcap">Dear Baron</span>,—I have misgivings about being on the right track, and feel
sorry you have set Minghelli to work so soon. Do Prime Ministers appoint
people at the mere mention of their names by wards, second cousins, and
lady friends generally? Wouldn't it have been wise to make inquiries?
What was the fault for which Minghelli was dismissed in London?</p><p style="padding-top:.5em">親愛的男爵，我擔心我走在正確的道路上，對你這麼快就讓明赫利開始工作感到遺憾。首相是否會僅因病房、表親和女性朋友常常提到他們的名字就任命他們？我們是否應該先進行調查呢？明赫利在倫敦被解僱的原因是什麼？</p>
<p>"As for D. R., I must have been mistaken about his knowing me. He
doesn't seem to know me at all, and I believe his shot at me by way of
my father was a fluke. At all events, I'm satisfied that it is going in
the wrong direction to set Minghelli on his trail. <i>Leave him to me
alone.</i>—Yours,</p><p>至於D.R.，我可能錯誤地以為他認識我。他似乎完全不認識我，我認為他透過我父親對我進行的射擊只是一次偶然。無論如何，我確信讓明赫利去追蹤他是走錯了方向。讓我一個人來處理他。－你的。</p>

<h3 id="pgepubid00114">IV</h3>
<p>The little Princess called for Roma the following night, and they drove
to the opera in her magnificent English carriage. Already the theatre
was full and the orchestra was tuning up. With the movement of people
arriving and recognising each other there was an electrical atmosphere
which affected everybody. Don Camillo came, oiled and perfumed, and when
he had removed the cloaks of the ladies and they took their places in
the front of the box, there was a slight tingling all over the house.
This pleased the little Princess immensely, and she began to sweep the
place with her opera-glass.</p><p>小公主在第二天晚上叫來了羅馬，他們乘坐她華麗的英國馬車去了歌劇院。劇院裡已經座無虛席，樂隊正在調音。隨著人們的到來和互相認識，劇院中充滿了電氣般的氛圍，影響到了每一個人。當Don Camillo帶著油光和香氣出現，當他為那些淑女除去披風，當他們在包廂前排就座時，整個劇院都微微地震動起來。這極為討好小公主，她開始用她的望遠鏡掃視整個場地。</p>
<p>"Crowded already!" she said. "And every face looking up at my box!
That's what it is to have for your companion the most beautiful and the
most envied girl in Rome. What a sensation! Nothing to what it will be,
though, when your illustrious friend arrives."</p><p>"已經擠滿人了！"她說。"所有的人都朝著我的包廂看上來！如此陪伴著羅馬最美麗和最被羨慕的女孩，這就是什麼感覺。真是一種轟動！不過等你那位享負盛名的朋友來了，那會是另一種感覺。”</p>
<p>At that moment David Rossi appeared at the back, and the Princess
welcomed him effusively.</p><p>就在那一刻，大衛·羅西出現在後方，公主熱情地歡迎他。</p>
<p>"So glad! So honoured! Gi-gi, let me introduce you—Honourable Rossi,
Don Camillo Luigi Murelli."</p><p>如此高興！如此榮幸！Gi-gi，讓我介紹你—榮譽的羅西，
唐·卡米洛·路易吉·穆雷利。</p>
<p>Roma looked at him—he had an air of distinction in a dress coat such as
comes to one man in a thousand. He looked at Roma—she wore a white gown
with violets on one shoulder and two rows of pearls about her beautiful
white throat. The Princess looked at both of them, and her little eyes
twinkled.</p><p>洛瑪看著他——他身著禮服，散發出千人之中只有一人才能擁有的尊貴氣質。他看著洛瑪——她穿著白色的禮服，肩上點綴著紫色的小花，美麗的潔白頸部繫著兩排珍珠。公主看著他們兩人，她的小眼睛閃著微光。</p>
<p>"Never been here before, Mr. Rossi? Then you must allow me to explain
everything. Take this chair between Roma and myself. No, you must not
sit back. <i>You</i> can't mind observation—so used to it, you know."</p><p>羅西先生，您從未來過這裡嗎？那麼請讓我解釋一切。請坐在我和羅瑪之間的這張椅子上。不，你不能靠背坐下。你不會介意被觀察—你知道的，你習慣了。</p>
<p>Without further ado David Rossi took his place in front of the box, and
then a faint commotion passed over the house. There were looks of
surprise and whispered comments, and even some trills of laughter.</p><p>毫不猶豫，大衛·羅西走到了箱子前，然後家中傳來微弱的騷動。驚訝的表情與低聲的評論，甚至有些人發出了輕柔的笑聲。</p>
<p>He bore it without flinching, as if he had come for it and expected it,
and was taking it as a penance.</p><p>他毫不退縮地承受著，就像他是為此而來，預料會這樣，並把它當作一種贖罪。</p>
<p>Roma dropped her head and felt ashamed, but the little Princess went on
talking. "These boxes on the first tier are occupied by Roman society
generally, those on the second tier mainly by the diplomatic corps, and
the stalls are<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00115" title="86"><a id="Page_86" title="86"></a></span> filled by all sorts and conditions of people—political
people, literary people, even trades-people if they're rich enough or
can pretend to be."</p><p>羅馬低下頭，感到羞愧，但小公主繼續講話。"第一層的包廂通常被羅馬社會的人佔據，第二層的包廂主要由外交團體佔據，而剩下的座位則被各種各樣的人填滿，包括政界人士、文學人士，甚至富有的商人，或者那些可以假裝自己富有的商人。"</p>
<p>"And the upper circles?" asked Rossi.</p><p>"上層圈子呢？"羅西問。</p>
<p>"Oh," in a tired voice, "professional people, I think—Collegio Romano
and University of Rome, you know."</p><p>"哦，" 疲倦的聲音"我認為是專業人士，你知道，羅馬學院和羅馬大學的人。"</p>
<p>"And the gallery?"</p><p>"那個畫廊呢？"</p>
<p>"Students, I suppose." Then eagerly, after bowing to somebody below,
"Gi-gi, there's Lu-lu. Don't forget to ask him to supper.... All the
beautiful young men of Rome are here to-night, Mr. Rossi, and presently
they'll pay a round of calls on the ladies in the boxes."</p><p>"我想是學生。" 然後，急切地向下面的某人鞠躬，
"吉吉，露露在那裡。不要忘了邀請他來吃晚飯。今晚羅馬所有美麗的年輕男子都在這裡，羅西先生，他們稍後會去拜訪包廂裡的女士們。"</p>
<p>The voice of the Princess was suddenly drowned by the sharp tap of the
conductor, followed by the opening blast of the overture. Then the
lights went down and the curtain rose, but still the audience kept up a
constant movement in the lower regions of the house, and there was an
almost unbroken chatter.</p><p>公主的聲音突然被指揮者的尖銳敲擊聲淹沒，隨後是序曲的開始。然後燈光熄滅，幕布升起，但觀眾在劇院下方區域的不停動作和幾乎沒有間斷的喋喋不休仍在繼續。</p>
<p>The curtain fell on the first act without anybody knowing what the opera
had been about, except that Samson loved a woman named Delilah, and the
lords of the Philistines were tempting her to betray him. Students in
the gallery, recognisable by their thin beards, shouted across at each
other for the joy of shouting, and spoke by gestures to their professors
below. People all over the house talked gaily on social subjects, and
there was much opening and shutting of the doors of boxes. The beautiful
young man called Lu-lu came to pay his respects to the Princess, and
there was a good deal of gossip and laughter.</p><p>在第一幕落幕時，沒有人知道這齣歌劇到底在討論什麼，只知道參孫愛上了一個名叫得利拉的女人，並且非利士的領主們正在誘惑她背叛他。畫廊中的學生，由他們稀疏的鬍鬚可以識別出來，他們互相之間尖叫以此來取樂，並且用手勢與下面的教授溝通。在劇院的各處，人們都在愉快地談論社交話題，包廂的門也是開閉不停。一個叫做Lu-lu的美麗年輕男子來向公主進行敬禮，場面上充滿了生動的八卦和笑聲。</p>
<p>The second act was more dramatic than the first, showing Samson in his
character as a warrior, and when the curtain came down again, General
Morra, the Minister of War, visited the Princess's box.</p><p>第二幕比第一幕更具戲劇性，展示了參孫作為戰士的角色，當幕布再次落下時，戰爭部長摩拉將軍，訪問了公主的包廂。</p>
<p>"So you're taking lessons in the art of war from the professor who slew
an army with the jaw-bone of an ass?" said Don Camillo.</p><p>"所以你正在向那位用驢骨殺死一支軍隊的教授學習戰爭的藝術嗎？"唐·卡米洛說。</p>
<p>"Wish we could enlist a few thousands of him—jaw-bones as well," said
the General. "The gentleman might be worth having at the War Office, if
it was only as a <i>jettatura</i>." And then in a low voice to the Princess,
with a glance at Roma, "Your beautiful young friend doesn't look so well
to-night."<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00116" title="87"><a id="Page_87" title="87"></a></span></p><p>"真希望我們能吸收他這樣的人幾千名——連他的下巴骨頭也一起，"將軍說。"如果只是作為一個厄運象徵，那位紳士在戰爭辦公室可能也有點價值。"然後他低聲對公主說，眼神掃向羅馬，"你美麗的年輕朋友今晚看起來不太好。"</p>
<p>The Princess shrugged her shoulders. "Of the pains of love one suffers
but does not die," she whispered.</p><p>公主聳了聳肩。 "愛的痛苦使人痛苦，但並不致死，"她低聲細語。</p>
<p>"You surely cannot mean...."</p><p>你肯定不是真的意味著....</p>
<p>The Princess put the tip of her fan to his lips and laughed.</p><p>公主將她的扇子尖端放在他的嘴唇上，然後笑了。</p>
<p>Roma was conscious of a strange conflict of feelings. The triumph she
had promised herself by David Rossi's presence with her in public—the
triumph over the envious ones who would have rejoiced in her
downfall—brought her no pleasure.</p><p>羅馬意識到了奇怪的情感衝突。她將大衛·羅西在公眾面前的存在視為自己的勝利，這是她承諾給自己的——這是對那些會為她的垮臺而歡欣鼓舞的人的勝利，但這並沒有帶給她任何的快樂。</p>
<p>The third act dealt with the allurements of Delilah, and was received
with a good deal of laughter.</p><p>第三幕處理了利拉的誘惑，並引起了不少的笑聲。</p>
<p>"Ah, these sweet, round, soft things—they can do anything they like
with the giants," said Don Camillo.</p><p>"啊，這些甜美、圓潤、柔軟的東西——他們可以對巨人做任何他們喜歡的事情，"唐卡米洛說。</p>
<p>The Baron, who had dined with the King, came round at the end of the
next act, wearing a sash diagonally across his breast, with crosses,
stars, and other decorations. He bowed to David Rossi with ceremonious
politeness, greeted Don Camillo familiarly, kissed the hand of the
Princess, and offered his arm to Roma to take her into the corridor to
cool—she was flushed and overheated.</p><p>男爵，他曾與國王共進晚餐，在下一個行動結束時出現，胸前斜著掛著腰帶，上面插有十字架、星星和其他的裝飾物。他對大衛·羅西鄭重地鞠躬，熟絡地向唐·卡米洛打招呼，吻了公主的手，然後向羅馬提出他的手臂，帶她去走廊裡冷卻——她臉紅，過熱了。</p>
<p>"I see you are getting on, my child! Excellent idea to bring him here!
Everybody is saying you cannot be the person he intended, so his trumpet
has brayed to no purpose."</p><p>我看見你正在進步，我的孩子！把他帶來這裡，真是個很好的想法！大家都在說你不可能是他原本的目標，所以他的號角白吹了。</p>
<p>"You received my letters?" she said in a faltering voice.</p><p>"你收到我的信了嗎？"她顫抖的聲音說。</p>
<p>"Yes, but don't be uneasy. I'm neither the prophet nor the son of a
prophet if we are not on the right track. What a fortunate thought about
the man Minghelli! An inspiration! You asked what his fault was in
London—forgery, my dear!"</p><p>"是的，但不必擔心。如果我們沒有走對路，我既不是先知，也不是先知的兒子。關於明赫利這個人的想法真是幸運！一個靈感！您問他在倫敦的錯誤是什麼——偽造，親愛的!"</p>
<p>"That's serious enough, isn't it?"</p><p>那已經夠嚴重了，不是嗎？</p>
<p>"In a Secretary of Legation, yes, but in a police agent...."</p><p>對於公使秘書來說，的確，但對於警察機關....</p>
<p>He laughed significantly, and she felt her skin creep.</p><p>他顯著地笑了，她感到自己的皮膚起雞皮疙瘩。</p>
<p>"Has he found out anything?" she asked.</p><p>"他有發現什麼嗎？"她問。</p>
<p>"Not yet, but he is clearly on the track of great things. It is nearly
certain that your King David is a person wanted by the law."</p><p>還沒有，但他明顯在追求偉大的事物的道路上。幾乎可以確定你的大衛國王是法律所追尋的人。</p>
<p>Her hand twitched at his arm, but they were turning at the end of the
corridor and she pretended to trip over her train.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00117" title="88"><a id="Page_88" title="88"></a></span></p><p>她的手在他的手臂上抽搐，但他們正在走廊的盡頭轉彎，她假裝在她的長裙上絆倒。</p>
<p>"Some clues missing still, however, and to find them we are sending
Minghelli to London."</p><p>然而，仍有一些線索遺失，為了找到它們，我們正在派明赫利去倫敦。</p>
<p>"London? Anything connected with my father?"</p><p>"倫敦？與我的父親有任何關聯嗎?"</p>
<p>"Possibly! We shall see. But there's the orchestra and here's your box!
You're wonderful, my dear! Already you've undone the mischief he did
you, and one half of your task is accomplished. Diplomatists! Pshaw!
We'll all have to go to school to a girl. Adieu!"</p><p>可能吧！我們將會看到。但樂隊在那裡，你的包廂在這裡！
你真了不起，我親愛的！你已經解開了他對你的危害，你的任務已經完成了一半。外交官！呸！
我們都得向一個女孩學習。再見！</p>
<p>All through the next act Roma seemed to feel a sting on her arm where
the Baron had touched it, and she was conscious of colouring up when the
Princess said:</p><p>在接下來的一幕中，羅馬似乎一直感覺到男爵觸碰她的手臂處有刺痛感，當公主說的時候，她意識到臉頰的發熱。</p>
<p>"Everybody is looking this way, my dear! See what it is to be the most
talked-of girl in Rome!"</p><p>"每個人都在看這邊，親愛的!看看作為羅馬最受關注的女孩是什麼感覺!"</p>
<p>And then she felt David Rossi's hand on the back of her chair, and heard
his soft voice saying:</p><p>然後她感覺到David Rossi的手放在她椅子的背部，並聽到他的聲音輕輕地說：</p>
<p>"The light is in your eyes, Donna Roma. Let me change places with you
for a while."</p><p>燈光照在你眼中，唐娜羅馬。讓我們暫時交換一下位置吧。</p>
<p>After that everything passed in a kind of confusion. She heard somebody
say:</p><p>之後的一切都在某種混亂之中過去。她聽到有人說：</p>
<p>"He's putting a good deal of heart into it, poor thing!"</p><p>他真的很投入，可憐的孩子！</p>
<p>And somebody answered, "Yes, of broken heart apparently."</p><p>而有人回答說，"看來是心碎了。"</p>
<p>Then there was a crash and the opera was over, and she was going out in
a crowd on David Rossi's arm, and feeling as if she would fall if she
dropped it.</p><p>然後傳來一聲巨響，歌劇結束了，她在大眾中，扶著大衛·羅西的手臂走出來，感覺如果放手，她就會跌倒。</p>
<p>The magnificent English carriage drew up under the portico and all four
of them got into it.</p><p>壯麗的英國馬車停在門廊下，他們四人都上了車。</p>
<p>"Grand Hotel!" cried Don Camillo. Then dropping back to his place he
laughed and chanted:</p><p>"大酒店！"唐·卡米洛大喊。然後他倒回到他的位置，哈哈大笑並高唱：</p>
<p>"And the dead he slew at his death were more than he slew in his
life ... and he judged Israel twenty years."</p><p>他死時殺死的人比他在生時殺的還多...他審判以色列二十年。</p>
<h3 id="pgepubid00118">V</h3>
<p>A marshy air from the Campagna shrouded the city as with a fog, and
pierced through the closed windows of the carriage, but there was warmth
and glow in the Grand Hotel.</p><p>來自坎帕尼亞的濕潤空氣像霧一樣籠罩著這座城市，並穿透了已關上的車窗，但在大酒店裡，卻充滿了溫暖和熱度。</p>
<p>One woman after another came in clothed in diamonds under the fur cloak
which hung over her bare arms and shoulders, until the room was a
dazzling blaze of jewels.</p><p>一位接一位的女性穿戴著鑽石裝飾走進來，寒毛斗篷掛在光滑的手臂和肩膀上，直到整個房間都被璀璨的寶石光芒所照耀。</p>
<p>People caught each other's eyes through lorgnettes and eye-glasses, and
there were constant salutations. The men<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00119" title="89"><a id="Page_89" title="89"></a></span> chattered, the women laughed,
and there was an affectation of baby-talk at nearly every table. Then
supper was served, glasses were held up as signals, and bright eyes
began to play about the room, until the atmosphere was tingling with
electric currents and heated by human passion.</p><p>人們透過望遠鏡和眼鏡互相交換目光，不斷的問候。男人們在嘰嘰喳喳，女人們哈哈大笑，幾乎每一張桌子上都有一種矯揉造作的嬰兒談話。然後，晚餐被端上來，人們舉杯作為訊號，明亮的眼睛開始在房間裡穿梭，直到氛圍充滿了電流的刺激和人類的熱情。</p>
<p>Roma sat facing the Princess. She was still confused and preoccupied,
but when rallied upon her silence she brightened up for a moment and
tried to look buoyant and happy. David Rossi, who was on her left, was
still quiet and collected, but bore the same air as before, of a man
going through a penance.</p><p>羅馬坐在公主對面。她仍然感到困惑和憂心忡忡，但當人們嘲笑她的沉默時，她瞬間恢復了亮度，嘗試看上去充滿活力和快樂。在她左邊的大衛·羅西仍然安靜而冷靜，但仍然保持著之前那種像是在做苦行的人的樣子。</p>
<p>This was observed by Don Camillo, who sat on the right of the Princess,
and led to various little scenes.</p><p>這是由唐·卡米洛觀察到的，他坐在公主的右側，並引發了各種小情節。</p>
<p>"Very good company here, Mr. Rossi. Always sure of seeing some beautiful
young women," said Don Camillo.</p><p>"這裡的公司真好，羅西先生。總是確定能看到一些美麗的年輕女性，"唐卡米洛說。</p>
<p>"And beautiful young men, apparently," said David Rossi.</p><p>“顯然，還有美麗的年輕男子，”大衛·羅西說。</p>
<p>The beautiful young man called Lu-lu was there, and reaching over to Don
Camillo, and speaking in a whisper between the puff of a cigarette and a
sip of coffee, he said:</p><p>那個叫做Lu-lu的英俊年輕人在那裡，他伸手過去向Don Camillo說話，一邊嘆煙一邊喝咖啡，他低聲說道：</p>
<p>"Why doesn't the Minister buy the man up? Easy enough to buy the press
these days."</p><p>為什麼部長不購買這個人？如今買下媒體夠容易的。</p>
<p>"He's doing better than that," said Don Camillo. "He's drawing him from
opposition by the allurements of...."</p><p>“他做得比那更好，" 唐·卡米洛說道。"他正在用……的誘惑將他從反對派中吸引出來。”</p>
<p>"Office?"</p><p>辦公室</p>
<p>"No, the lady," whispered Don Camillo, but Roma heard him.</p><p>"不，那位女士，"唐·卡米洛低聲說，但羅馬聽到了他的話。</p>
<p>She was ashamed. The innuendoes which belittled David Rossi were
belittling herself as well, and she wanted to get up and fly.</p><p>她感到羞愧。那些貶低大衛·羅西的影射也同樣貶低了她自己，她想要站起來並飛走。</p>
<p>Rossi himself seemed to be unconscious of anything hurtful. Although
silent, he was calm and cheerful, and his manner was natural and polite.
The wife of one of the royal aides-de-camp sat next to him, and talked
constantly of the King.</p><p>羅西本人似乎對任何傷害一無所知。儘管沉默，他卻保持鎮定和愉快，舉止自然而有禮。皇家助營的妻子坐在他旁邊，不停地談論著國王。</p>
<p>Roma found herself listening to every word that was said to David Rossi,
but she also heard a conversation that was going on at the other end of
the table.</p><p>羅馬發現自己聽著每一個對大衛·羅西說的話，但她也聽到了桌子另一端正在進行的對話。</p>
<p>"Wants to be another Cola di Rienzi, doesn't he?" said Lu-lu.</p><p>“他想成為另一個科拉·迪·倫齊，不是嗎？”露露說。</p>
<p>"Another Christ," said Don Camillo. "He'll be asking for a crown of
thorns by-and-by, and calling on the world to immolate him for the sake
of humanity. Look! He's talking<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00120" title="90"><a id="Page_90" title="90"></a></span> to the little Baroness, but he is
fifteen thousand miles above the clouds at this moment."</p><p>"另一個基督，"唐·卡米洛說。"他接下來可能會要求一個荊棘冠，並呼籲世界為了人類的利益而犧牲他。看！他正在和小男爵夫人說話，但此刻他卻在雲端上萬五千英里的地方。"</p>
<p>"Where does he come from, I wonder?" said Lu-lu, and then the two hands
of Don Camillo played the invisible accordion.</p><p>“他從哪裡來的呢，我在想？”露露說，然後，當卡米洛的兩隻手彈奏起了無形的手風琴。</p>
<p>"Madame de Trop says his father was Master of the House to Prince
Petrolium—vice-prince, you know, and brought up in the little palace,"
said the Princess.</p><p>"德特羅夫夫人說他的父親曾經是石油王子的家庭管家，你知道，那位副王子，並在小宮殿中長大。"公主說。</p>
<p>"Don't believe a word of it," said Don Camillo, "and I'll wager he never
supped at a decent hotel before."</p><p>"別相信他說的任何話，"唐·卡米洛說，"我敢打賭，他以前從來沒有在像樣的酒店吃過晚餐。"</p>
<p>"I'll ask him! Listen now! Some fun," said the Princess. "Honourable
Rossi!"</p><p>"我會問他！現在聽好！有些有趣的事情，"公主說。"尊貴的羅西！"</p>
<p>"Yes, Princess," said David Rossi.</p><p>"好的，公主，"大衛·羅西說。</p>
<p>The eyes of the little Princess swept the table with a sparkling light.</p><p>小公主的眼睛閃著光芒掃視著桌子。</p>
<p>"Beautiful room, isn't it?"</p><p>漂亮的房間，不是嗎？</p>
<p>"Beautiful."</p><p>美麗</p>
<p>"Never been here before, I suppose?"</p><p>"你應該是第一次來這裡吧？"</p>
<p>David Rossi looked steadfastly into her eyes and answered, "Oh yes,
Princess. When I first returned to Italy eight years ago I was a waiter
in this house for a month."</p><p>"大衛·羅西堅定地看著她的眼睛，回答道，“哦，公主。當我八年前首次回到義大利時，我在這座房子裡做了一個月的服務員。”</p>
<p>The sparkling face of the little Princess broke up like a snowball in
the sun, and the two other men dropped their heads.</p><p>那位小公主閃亮的臉龐就如同陽光下的雪球般瓦解，而其他兩名男子也低下了他們的頭。</p>
<p>Roma hardly knew what her own feelings were. Humiliation, shame,
confusion, but above all, pride—pride in David Rossi's courage and
strength.</p><p>羅馬幾乎不知道她自己的感受是什麼。羞愧，羞辱，混亂，但最重要的是驕傲——對大衛·羅西的勇氣和力量的驕傲。</p>
<p>The white mist from the Campagna pierced to the bone as they came out by
the glass-covered hall, and an old woman with an earthenware scaldino,
crouching by the marble pillars in the street, held out a chill, damp
hand and cried:</p><p>當他們從玻璃覆蓋的大廳走出來時，來自坎帕尼亞的白霧刺骨而入。街上一位疊著瓦器熱爐的老婦人蹲在大理石柱旁，她伸出冷濕的手，大聲痛哭。</p>
<p>"A penny for God's sake! May I die unconfessed if I've eaten anything
since yesterday!... God bless you, my daughter! and the Holy Virgin and
all the saints!"</p><p>"為了上帝的緣故，給我一分錢吧！如果我說自從昨天以來我沒有吃過任何東西的話，願我在未告罪的情況下死去！...願上帝祝福你，我的女兒！以及聖母和所有的聖人！"</p>
<p>At the door of her house Roma parted from the Princess, and said to
Rossi, as the carriage drove away, "Come early to-morrow. I've not yet
been able to work properly somehow."</p><p>在她家門口，羅馬與公主分別，並對羅西說，當馬車開走時，“明天早點來。我還沒有辦法以某種方式正確地工作。”</p>
<p>She was restless and feverish, and she would have gone to bed
immediately, but crossing the drawing-room she heard the fretful voice
of her aunt saying, "Is that you, Roma?" and she had no choice but to go
into the Countess's bedroom.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00121" title="91"><a id="Page_91" title="91"></a></span></p><p>她煩躁且發熱，本來可以立刻上床休息。但走過起居室的時候，她聽到了她阿姨的不悅聲音說：“是你，羅馬嗎？”所以她別無選擇，只能走進伯爵夫人的臥室。</p>
<p>A red lamp burned before the shrine, and the old lady was in an
embroidered nightdress, but she was wide awake, and her eyes flashed and
her lips trembled.</p><p>一盞紅燈籠在神壇前燃燒，老太太身穿著一件刺繡的睡衣，但她卻睜眼矚目，眼神閃爍，嘴唇顫抖。</p>
<p>"Ah, it's you at last! Sit down! I want to speak to you. Natalina!"
cried the Countess. "Oh, dear me, the girl has gone to bed. Give me the
cognac. There it is—on the dressing-table."</p><p>"啊，終於是你來了！坐下吧！我想和你說話。娜塔麗娜！"伯爵夫人喊道。 "哦，天呀，那個女孩已經去睡覺了。給我白蘭地。就在那裡-在梳妝臺上。"</p>
<p>She sipped the brandy, fidgeted with her cambric handkerchief, and said:</p><p>她小口品嚐著白蘭地，慌張地擺弄著她的卡布裡克手帕，然後說道：</p>
<p>"Roma, I'm surprised at you! You hadn't used to be so stupid! How? Don't
you see what that woman is doing? What woman? The Princess, of course.
Inviting you to share her box at the opera so that you may be seen in
public with that man. She hates him like poison, but she would swallow
anything to throw you and this Rossi together. Do you expect the Baron
to approve of that? His enemy, and you on such terms with the man? Here,
take back this cognac. I feel as if I would choke—Natalina...."</p><p>"羅馬，我真的對你感到意外！你以前不曾如此愚蠢！嗯？你難道看不見那個女人正在做什麼嗎？什麼女人？當然是公主。她邀請你在歌劇院和她一起分享包廂，讓你可以公開和這個男人一起被看到。她像毒藥一樣恨他，但為了把你和羅西扔在一起，她什麼都可以忍受。你期待男爵會贊同這種事嗎？她的敵人，而你和這個男人的關係如此親近？來，把這個干邑酒拿回去。我覺得我快要被噎死了—納塔麗娜...."</p>
<p>"You're quite mistaken, Aunt Betsy," said Roma. "The Baron was at the
opera and came into the box himself, and he approved of everything."</p><p>"你大錯特錯了，貝特西阿姨，" 羅馬說。"男爵在歌劇院，他親自來到看臺，他贊同所有事情。"</p>
<p>"Tut! Don't tell me! Because he has some respect for himself and keeps
his own counsel you are simple enough to think he will not be offended."</p><p>呸！別告訴我！因為他尊重自己並保持沉默，你真的天真到以為他不會感到被冒犯。</p>
<p>The old lady's voice was dying down to a choking whisper, but she went
on without a pause.</p><p>那位老婦人的聲音逐漸變得低沉，幾乎到了嘶啞的程度，但她卻沒有停順著說下去。</p>
<p>"If you've no thought for yourself, you might have some for me. You are
young, and anything may come to you, but I'm old and I'm tied down to
this mattress, and what is to happen if the Baron takes offence? The
income he allows us from your father's estates is under his own control
still. He can cut it off at any moment, and if he does, what is to
become of me?"</p><p>如果你對自己沒有所顧忌，或許能對我有些考慮。你年輕，任何事都可能發生在你身上，但我已經老了，我被束縛在這張床墊上，如果男爵生氣了會怎樣呢？他允許我們從你父親的產業中獲得的收入仍然在他的控制之下。他隨時都可以切斷這筆收入，如果他這樣做了，我該怎麼辦呢？</p>
<p>Roma's bosom was swelling under her heavy breathing, her heart was
beating violently and her head was dizzy. All the bitterness of the
evening was boiling in her throat, and it burst out at length in a
flood.</p><p>羅馬的胸膛因她沉重的呼吸而起伏不定，心跳激烈，頭腦感到暈眩。所有夜晚的苦澀在她的喉嚨中沸騰，最終爆發成洪流。</p>
<p>"So that is all your moral protestations come to, is it?" she said.
"Because the Baron is necessary to you and you cannot exist without him,
you expect me to buy and sell myself according to your necessities."</p><p>"所以這就是你所有道德抗議的核心吧？"她說。 "因為男爵對你來說是不可或缺的，而你無法自我存在，你希望我根據你的需要來賣淫和出賣自己。"</p>
<p>"Roma! What are you saying? Aren't you ashamed...."</p><p>羅馬！你在說什麼？你不覺得羞恥嗎……</p>
<p>"Aren't <i>you</i> ashamed? You've been trying to throw me<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00122" title="92"><a id="Page_92" title="92"></a></span> into the arms of
the Baron, and you haven't cared what would happen so long as I kept up
appearances."</p><p>你不覺得羞恥嗎？你一直試圖將我推向男爵的懷抱，只要我保持外表，你就不會關心會發生什麼。</p>
<p>"Oh, dear! I see what it is. You want to be the death of me! You will,
too, before you've done. Natalina! Where is...."</p><p>哎呀，我看出來了。你是想要我死！你也會在你完成前讓我死的。娜塔莉娜！在哪裡...</p>
<p>"More than that, you've poisoned my mind against my father, and because
I couldn't remember him, you've brought me up to think of him as selfish
and vain and indifferent to his own daughter. But my father wasn't that
kind of man at all."</p><p>更甚者，你已經把我的思想毒化了，反對我的父親，因為我不能記得他，你把我養大，讓我認為他自私、虛榮、對他自己的女兒漠不關心。但我的父親一點也不是這種人。</p>
<p>"Who told you that, miss?"</p><p>是誰告訴你的，小姐？</p>
<p>"Never mind who told me. My father was a saint and a martyr, and a great
man, and he loved me with all his heart and soul."</p><p>不要管是誰告訴我的。我父親是位聖人與烈士，他是一位偉大的人，並且他用他全部的心與靈愛我。</p>
<p>"Oh, my head! My poor head!... A martyr indeed! A socialist, a
republican, a rebel, an anarchist, you mean!"</p><p>哎喲，我的頭啊！我的可憐的頭！……確實是個烈士！你是說，一個社會主義者，一個共和主義者，一個反叛者，一個無政府主義者！</p>
<p>"Never mind what his politics were. He was my father—that is
enough—and you had no right to make <i>me</i> think ill of him, whatever the
world might do."</p><p>不管他的政治立場如何，他是我父親──這就足夠了──你沒有權利讓我對他產生不好的想法，無論世界怎麼看他。</p>
<p>Roma was superb at that moment, with her head thrown back, her eyes
flaming, and her magnificent figure swelling and heaving under her
clinging gown.</p><p>在那一刻，羅馬表現得非常出色，她的頭向後仰，眼中閃爍著火焰般的光芒，她雄偉的身材在緊身長袍下起伏不定。</p>
<p>"You'll kill me, I tell you. The cognac ... Natalina...." cried the
Countess, but Roma was gone.</p><p>“你會害死我的，我告訴你。這杯干邑酒......納塔利娜......"伯爵夫人哭喊著，但羅馬已經離去。</p>
<p>Before going to bed Roma wrote to the Baron:</p><p>在上床睡覺之前，羅馬寫信給男爵：</p>
<p style="padding-top:.5em">"Certain you are wrong. Why waste time sending Charles Minghelli to
London? Why? Why? Why? The forger will find out nothing, and if he does,
it will only be by exercise of his Israelitish art of making bricks
without straw. Stop him at once if you wish to save public money and
spare yourself personal disappointment. Stop him! Stop him! Stop him!</p><p style="padding-top:.5em">你肯定是錯的。為什麼要浪費時間將查爾斯·明格利送到倫敦？為什麼？為什麼？為什麼？偽造者將一無所獲，即使他有所發現，也只是因為他使用以色列人的技巧製造無稻草的磚。如果你希望節省公共資金，並避免自己感到失望，那就立即阻止他！阻止他！阻止他！</p>
<p style="padding-bottom:.5em">"P.S.—To show you how far astray your man has gone, D. R. mentioned
to-night that he was once a waiter at the Grand Hotel!"</p><p style="padding-bottom:.5em">附註：為了讓你瞭解你的人走得有多遠，D. R.今晚提到他曾經在大酒店當過服務員！</p>
<h3 id="pgepubid00123">VI</h3>
<p>Next morning David Rossi arrived early.</p><p>次日一早，大衛·羅西便抵達了。</p>
<p>"Now we must get to work in earnest," said Roma. "I think I see my way
at last."<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00124" title="93"><a id="Page_93" title="93"></a></span></p><p>"我們現在必須認真開始工作了，" 羅馬說。 "我想我終於看到前進的道路了。"</p>
<p>It was not John the beloved disciple, John who lay in the bosom of his
Lord. It was Peter, the devoted, stalwart, brave individual, human,
erring but glorious Peter. "Thou art Peter, and on this rock I build my
church."</p><p>這不是摯愛的門徒約翰，那個擁抱主的約翰。這是彼得，那個忠誠，堅定，勇敢的個人，有著人性的缺點但光榮的彼得。"你是彼得，我要在這塊磐石上建立我的教會。"</p>
<p>"Same position as before. Eyes the other way. Thank you!... Afraid you
didn't enjoy yourself last night—no?"</p><p>與之前相同的位置。眼睛看向另一邊。謝謝!...你昨晚沒有享受吧 - 不是嗎?</p>
<p>"At the theatre? I was interested. But the human spectacle was perhaps
more to me than the artistic one. I am no artist, you see.... How did
<i>you</i> become a sculptor?"</p><p>在劇院？我對此很有興趣。但對我來說，人間的景象可能比藝術表現更有吸引力。你看，我不是藝術家......你是如何成為雕塑家的呢？</p>
<p>"Oh, I studied a little in the studios of Paris, where I went to school,
you see."</p><p>"哦，我在巴黎的工作室裡學習了一點，我在那裡上學，你知道的。"</p>
<p>"But you were born in London?"</p><p>"但你是在倫敦出生的嗎？"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p><p>是</p>
<p>"Why did you come to Rome?"</p><p>你為什麼來到羅馬？</p>
<p>"Rome was the home of my people, you know. And then there was my
name—Roma!"</p><p>"羅馬曾是我的人民的家，你知道的。然後還有我的名字——羅馬！"</p>
<p>"I knew a Roma long ago."</p><p>我很久以前認識一個羅馬人。</p>
<p>"Really? Another Roma?"</p><p>真的嗎？又一個羅馬人？</p>
<p>There was a tremor in her voice.</p><p>她的聲音中帶著顫抖。</p>
<p>"It was the little daughter of the friend I've spoken about."</p><p>那是我提過的朋友的小女兒。</p>
<p>"How interest ... No, at the window, please—that will do."</p><p>「多麼有趣... 不，請移到窗邊，那就好。」</p>
<p>Roma was choking with a sense of duplicity, but save for a turn of the
head David Rossi gave no sign.</p><p>羅馬被虛偽的感覺扼住了喉嚨，但除了轉頭之外，大衛·羅西無任何表示。</p>
<p>"She was only seven when I saw her last."</p><p>當我最後一次見到她時，她只有七歲。</p>
<p>"That was long ago, you say?"</p><p>那是很久以前，你說？</p>
<p>"Seventeen years ago."</p><p>十七年前</p>
<p>"Then she will be the same age as...."</p><p>那麼她將與那個人的年紀相當...</p>
<p>"The first time I saw her she was only three, and she was in her
nightdress ready for bed."</p><p>我第一次見到她時，她只有三歲，已經換上了她的睡衣準備上床睡覺。</p>
<p>Roma laughed a little, but she knew that every note in her voice was
confused and false.</p><p>羅馬微微笑了，但她知道自己聲音中的每一個音符都是混亂和虛偽的。</p>
<p>"She said her prayers with a little lisp at that time. 'Our Fader oo art
in heben, alud be dy name.'"</p><p>她那時候帶著一點口齒不清地禱告。'我們的天父，禰在天上，願禰的名被尊崇。'</p>
<p>He laughed a little now, as he mimicked the baby voice. They laughed
together, then they looked at each other, and then with serious eyes
they turned away.</p><p>他現在微微笑著，模仿著嬰兒的聲音。他們一起笑了，然後彼此看了看，接著他們用嚴肅的眼神轉過頭去。</p>
<p>"You'll think it strange, but I date my first conscious and definite
aspiration to the memory of that hour."</p><p>你可能會覺得奇怪，但我把我的第一個清晰且確定的渴望，追溯到那一個小時的記憶。</p>
<p>"Really?"</p><p>真的嗎？</p>
<p>"Ten years afterward, when I was in America, the words<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00125" title="94"><a id="Page_94" title="94"></a></span> of that prayer
came back to me in Roma's little lisp. 'Dy kingum tum. Dy will be done
on eard as it is in heben.'"</p><p>"十年後，當我在美國時，那禱告的話語以 Roma 的小口舌迴盪在我心中。'Dy kingum tum，Dy will 在 eard 如同在 heben 成全。'"</p>
<p>For some time after that Roma worked on without speaking, feeling
feverish and restless. But just as the silence was becoming painful, and
she could bear it no longer, Felice came to announce lunch.</p><p>在那之後的一段時間裡，羅馬一直默默地工作，感到發熱和不安。 但正當沉默變得痛苦，她再也無法忍受時，費利斯來宣佈午餐的到來。</p>
<p>"You'll stay? I want so much to work on while I'm in the mood," she
said.</p><p>「你會留下來嗎？我很想把握住現在的心情去完成一些工作，」她說。</p>
<p>"With pleasure," he replied.</p><p>「樂意之至，」他回答。</p>
<p>She ate hardly at all, for she was troubled by many misgivings. Did he
know her? He did; he must; every word, every tone seemed to tell her
that. Then why did he not speak out plainly? Because, having revealed
himself to her, he was waiting for her to reveal herself to him. And why
had she not done so? Because she was enmeshed in the nets of the society
she lived in; because she was ashamed of the errand that had brought
them together; and most of all because she had not dared to lay bare
that secret of his life which, like an escaped convict, dragged behind
it the broken chain of the prison-house.</p><p>她幾乎不吃東西，因為她被許多疑慮所困擾。他認識她嗎？他確實知道；他一定知道；每個詞語，每個語調都似乎告訴她這一點。那麼他為什麼不明說出來呢？因為，他向她揭示了他自己，正在等她向他揭示她自己。她為什麼沒有這樣做呢？因為她被生活中的社會羈絆所網羅；因為她對將他們聚在一起的使命感到羞愧；最重要的是，她不敢公開他生活中的秘密，就像一個逃犯，身後拖著破碎的監獄鎖鏈。</p>
<p><i>David Leone is dead!</i> To uncover, even to their own eyes only, the fact
that lay hidden behind those words was like personating the priest and
listening at the grating of the confessional!</p><p>大衛·萊昂已經去世了！揭示那些話語背後隱藏的事實，即使只是對他們自己揭示，就像是扮演神父並在告解室的格子門後聆聽！</p>
<p>No matter! She must do it! She must reveal herself as her heart and
instinct might direct. She must claim the parentage of the noblest soul
that ever died for liberty, and David Rossi must trust his secret to the
bond of blood which would make it impossible for her to betray the
foster-son of her own father.</p><p>無論如何！她必須做到！她必須按照自己的心和直覺來揭示自己的身份。她必須認領那位曾為自由犧牲的最高貴的靈魂作為她的父母，並讓大衛·羅西將他的秘密託付給血緣關係，這種關係使她無法背叛她父親的養子。</p>
<p>Having come to this conclusion, the light seemed to break in her heavy
sky, but the clouds were charged with electricity. As they returned to
the studio she was excited and a little hysterical, for she thought the
time was near. At that moment a regiment of soldiers passed along under
the ilex trees to the Pincio, with their band of music playing as they
marched.</p><p>她得出這個結論之後，沉重的天空似乎打破了光明，但云層充滿了電力。當他們回到工作室時，她感到興奮且有點歇斯底里，因為她認為時間已經接近。就在那一刻，一個士兵團在冷杉樹下經過通往皮恩希奧，他們的樂隊在遊行時演奏音樂。</p>
<p>"Ah, the dear old days!" said David Rossi. "Everything reminds me of
them! I remember that when she was six...."</p><p>"啊，可愛的舊時光！"大衛·羅西說，"每件事都讓我想起它們！我記得她六歲的時候...."</p>
<p>"Roma?"</p><p>羅馬？</p>
<p>"Yes—a regiment of troops returned from a glorious campaign, and the
doctor took us to see the illuminations and<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00126" title="95"><a id="Page_95" title="95"></a></span> rejoicings. We came to a
great piazza almost as large as the piazza of St. Peter's, with
fountains and a tall column in the middle of it."</p><p>是的 - 一支軍隊從一場光榮的戰役中返回，醫生帶我們去看燈光和慶祝活動。我們來到一個近似聖彼得大教堂廣場大小的大廣場，中間有噴泉和一根高大的柱子。</p>
<p>"I know—Trafalgar Square!"</p><p>我知道—特拉法加廣場！</p>
<p>"Dense crowds covered the square, but we found a place on the steps of a
church."</p><p>廣場上擠滿了人群，但我們在一座教堂的臺階上找到了地方。</p>
<p>"I remember—St. Martin's Church. You see, I know London."</p><p>我記得－聖馬丁教堂。看，我熟悉倫敦。</p>
<p>"The soldiers came in by the big railway station close by...."</p><p>士兵們從附近的大型火車站進來......</p>
<p>"Charing Cross, isn't it."</p><p>"查令十字路口，不是嗎。"</p>
<p>"And they marched to the tune of the 'British Grenadiers' and the
thunder of fifty thousand throats. And as their general rode past, a
beacon of electric lights in the centre of the square blazed out like an
aureole about the statue of a great Englishman who had died long ago for
the cause which had then conquered."</p><p>他們跟著"英國手榴兵"的旋律前進，五萬人的呼聲如雷鳴般震天。當他們的將軍騎過去時，廣場中心的電燈如猛獸般燃燒起來，照亮了周圍的英國偉人雕像。這位偉人在很久以前為了當時的事業犧牲，而那事業已經取得了勝利。</p>
<p>"Gordon!" she cried—she was losing herself every moment.</p><p>“戈登！”她叫了出來——她感覺自己每一刻都在迷失自我。</p>
<p>"'Look, darling!' said the doctor to little Roma. And Roma said, 'Papa,
is it God?' I was a tall boy then, and stood beside him. 'She'll never
forget that, David,' he said."</p><p>"看，寶貝！"醫生對小羅馬說。羅馬說：“爸爸，那是上帝嗎？”那時我已經是個高高的男孩了，站在他旁邊。他說：“大衛，她永遠不會忘記這一刻。”</p>
<p>"And she didn't ... she couldn't ... I mean.... Have you ever told me what
became of her?"</p><p>她並沒有...她不能...我是說....你有沒有告訴過我她後來怎麼樣了？</p>
<p>She would reveal herself in a moment—only a moment—after all, it was
delicious to play with this sweet duplicity.</p><p>她將在一瞬間揭示自己——只是一瞬間——畢竟，與這種甜蜜的偽善玩耍是多麼愉快。</p>
<p>"Have you?" she said in a tremulous voice.</p><p>"你有嗎？”她顫抖的聲音說。</p>
<p>His head was down. "Dead!" he answered, and the tool dropped out of her
hand on to the floor.</p><p>他的頭垂下來，"死了！"他回答。工具從她的手中掉落在地板上。</p>
<p>"I was five years in America after the police expelled me from London,
and when I returned to England I went back to the little shop in Soho."</p><p>在警方將我驅逐出倫敦後，我在美國待了五年。當我返回英國時，我回到了蘇豪的那家小店。</p>
<p>She was staring at him and holding her breath. He was looking out of the
window.</p><p>她瞪著他，屏住了呼吸。他正在看窗外。</p>
<p>"The same people were there, and their own daughter was a grown-up girl,
but Roma was gone."</p><p>那些人都還在，他們的女兒也長大成人了，但羅馬已經不在了。</p>
<p>She could hear the breath in her nostrils.</p><p>她能聽到自己鼻孔中的呼吸聲。</p>
<p>"They told me she had been missing for a week, and then ... her body had
been found in the river."</p><p>他們告訴我，她已經失蹤一個星期了，然後...她的屍體在河裡被找到。</p>
<p>She felt like one struck dumb.</p><p>她感覺像是被驚嚇得說不出話來。</p>
<p>"The man took me to the grave. It was the grave of her mother in Kensal
Green, and under her mother's name I read her own inscription—'Sacred
also to the memory of<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00127" title="96"><a id="Page_96" title="96"></a></span> Roma Roselli, found drowned in the Thames, aged
twelve years.'"</p><p>那個男人帶我去了墳墓。那是她母親在肯薩爾綠地的墳墓，在她母親的名字下，我讀到了她自己的銘記——「也用以紀念洛馬·羅塞利，死於泰晤士河溺水，年僅十二歲。」</p>
<p>The warm blood which had tingled through her veins was suddenly frozen
with horror.</p><p>曾經在她血管中澎湃的暖血，突然間因驚恐而凝固。</p>
<p>"Not to-day," she thought, and at that moment a faint sound of the band
on the Pincio came floating in by the open window.</p><p>"不是今天，"她想。就在那一刻，來自賓奇奧樂隊的微弱聲音透過開著的窗戶飄了進來。</p>
<p>"I must go," said David Rossi, rising.</p><p>"我必須走了，"大衛·羅西起身說。</p>
<p>Then she recovered herself and began to talk on other subjects. When
would he come again? He could not say. The parliamentary session opened
soon. He would be very busy.</p><p>然後她恢復了自我，開始談論其他的主題。他何時會再來？
他無法確定。國會會議即將開始，他會非常忙。</p>
<p>When David Rossi was gone Roma went upstairs, and Natalina met her
carrying two letters. One of them was going to the post—it was from the
Countess to the Baron. The other was from the Baron to herself.</p><p>當大衛·羅西離去時，羅馬上樓去，她遇到了娜塔麗娜，手上拿著兩封信。其中一封即將去寄給男爵，是伯爵夫人的信。另一封則是男爵寫給她的。</p>
<p style="padding-top:.5em">"<span class="smcap">My dearest Roma</span>,—A thousand thanks for the valuable clue about the
Grand Hotel. Already we have followed up your lead, and we find that the
only David Rossi who was ever a waiter there gave as reference the name
of an Italian baker in Soho. Minghelli has gone to London, and I am
sending him this further information. Already he is fishing in strange
waters, and I am sure you are dying to know if he has caught anything.
So am I, but we must possess our souls in patience.</p><p style="padding-top:.5em">我最親愛的羅馬，非常感謝你提供的關於大酒店的寶貴線索。我們已經根據你的提示進行了行動，發現曾在那裡當過服務員的唯一一個名叫大衛·羅西的人，他的參考人是索霍的一個義大利麵包師。明格利已經前往倫敦，我正在向他傳送這些進一步的資訊。他已經在陌生的水域裡垂釣了，我確定你一定非常想知道他是否捕獲到了什麼。我也是，但我們必須保持耐心。</p>
<p>"But, my dearest Roma, what is happening to your handwriting? It is so
shaky nowadays that I can scarcely decipher some of it.—With love.</p><p>但是，我最親愛的羅馬，你的字跡怎麼了？近來搖搖晃晃的我幾乎難以辨認出來。-充滿愛意。</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Guardian</span>,—But I'm not—I'm not! I'm not in the least anxious to
hear of what Mr. Minghelli is doing in London, because I know he is
doing nothing, and whatever he says, either through his own mouth or the
mouth of his Italian baker in Soho, I shall never believe a word he
utters. As to Mr. Rossi, I am now perfectly sure that he does not
identify me at all. He believes my father's daughter is dead, and he has
just been telling me a shocking story of how the body of a young girl
was picked out of the Thames (about the time you took me away from
London) and buried in the name of Roma Roselli. He actually saw the
grave and the tombstone! Some scoundrel has been at work somewhere. Who
is it, I wonder?—Yours,</p><p>親愛的監護人，- 但我不是 - 我不是！對於明赫利先生在倫敦的行為，我一點也不感到焦慮，因為我知道他什麼也沒做，無論他透過自己的嘴巴或他在Soho的義大利麵包師傅的嘴巴說些什麼，我絕不會相信他說的任何話。至於羅西先生，我現在完全確定他並不認出我來。他認為我父親的女兒已經死了，他剛剛告訴我一個令人震驚的故事，即一具年輕女孩的屍體是如何從泰晤士河中被撈出來的（大約在你帶我離開倫敦的時候），並以羅馬·羅塞利的名義被埋葬。他實際上看到了墓地和墓碑！有些無賴在某處搞鬼。是誰呢，我在想? - 你的。</p>

<p><span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00129" title="97"><a id="Page_97" title="97"></a></span>Having
written this letter in the heat and haste of the first moment
after David Rossi's departure, she gave it to Bruno to post immediately.</p><p>寫完這封信是在大衛·羅西離開的第一時間內，匆忙且心情激動的情況下完成的，她立即給布魯諾寄出了。</p>
<p>"Just so!" said Bruno to himself, as he glanced at the superscription.</p><p>“就這樣！”布魯諾對自己說，當他看著上面的題詞。</p>
<p>Next morning she dressed carefully, as if expecting David Rossi as
usual, but when he did not come she told herself she was glad of it.
Things had happened too hurriedly; she wanted time to breathe and to
think.</p><p>隔天早晨，她精心打扮，彷彿期待大衛·羅西像往常一樣來訪，但當他沒有出現時，她告訴自己對此感到慶幸。事情發生得太匆忙，她需要時間來喘息和思考。</p>
<p>All day long she worked on the bust. It was a new delight to model by
memory, to remember an expression and then try to reproduce it. The
greatest difficulty lay in the limitation of her beautiful art. There
were so many memories, so many expressions, and the clay would take but
one of them.</p><p>她整日都在塑造那個胸像。憑記憶塑模是一種新的樂趣，記住一種表情，然後試著去重現它。最大的困難在於她那美妙藝術的限制。有那麼多的回憶，那麼多的表情，而黏土只能展現其中的一種。</p>
<p>The next day after that she dressed herself as carefully as before, but
still David Rossi did not come. No matter! It would give her time to
think of all he had said, to go over his words and stories.</p><p>在那之後的第二天，她和之前一樣小心翼翼地打扮自己，但是大衛·羅西仍然沒有來。沒關係！這會給她時間去思考他所說的所有話，去回顧他的話語和故事。</p>
<p>Did he know her? Certainly he knew her! He must have known from the
first that she was her father's daughter, or he would never have put
himself in her power. His belief in her was such a sweet thing. It was
delicious.</p><p>他認識她嗎？當然，他認識她！從一開始他就必須知道她是她父親的女兒，否則他永遠不會將自己置於她的掌控之中。他對她的信任是如此甜蜜的事情。這真是美妙至極。</p>
<p>Next day also David Rossi did not come, and she began to torture herself
with misgivings. Was he indifferent? Had all her day-dreams been
delusions? Little as she wished to speak to Bruno, she was compelled to
do so.</p><p>第二天，大衛·羅西依然沒有出現，她開始因疑慮而折磨自己。他是否漠不關心？她所有的白日夢是不是都只是幻覺？即使她不願意跟布魯諾說話，她也被迫這樣做。</p>
<p>Bruno hardly lifted his eyes from his chisel and soft iron hammer.
"Parliament is to meet soon," he said, "and when a man is leader of a
party he has enough to do, you know."</p><p>布魯諾幾乎無法把他的目光從鑿子和軟鐵錘上移開。"議會即將開會了,"他說,"當一個人是一個政黨的領導人時，他有很多事情要做，你知道的。"</p>
<p>"Ask him to come to-morrow. Say I wish for one more sitting—only one."</p><p>請求他明天來。告訴他我希望再坐一次，只需一次。</p>
<p>"I'll tell him," said Bruno, with a bob of his head over the block of
marble.</p><p>"我會告訴他的，"布魯諾說，頭部微微點向大理石塊。</p>
<p>But David Rossi did not come the next day either, and Bruno had no
better explanation.</p><p>但是大衛·羅西隔天也沒來，布魯諾也沒有更好的解釋。</p>
<p>"Busy with his new 'Republic' now, and no time to waste, I can tell
you."</p><p>他現在忙於他的新"共和國"，沒有時間可以浪費，我可以告訴你。</p>
<p>"He will never come again," she thought, and then everything around and
within her grew dark and chill.</p><p>"他再也不會回來了，"她想，然後她周圍和內心的一切都變得黑暗和寒冷。</p>
<p>She was sleeping badly, and to tire herself at night she went out to
walk in the moonlight along the path under the convent wall. She walked
as far as the Pincio gates, where the path broadens to a circular space
under a table of clipped<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00130" title="98"><a id="Page_98" title="98"></a></span> ilexes, beneath which there is a fountain and
a path going down to the Piazza di Spagna. The night was soft and very
quiet, and standing under the deep shadows of the trees, with only the
cruel stars shining through, and no sound in the air save the sobbing of
the fountain, she heard a man's footstep on the gravel coming up from
below.</p><p>她的睡眠質量不好，於是為了使自己在夜晚感到疲倦，她走出去在月光下沿著修道院牆壁的小徑散步。她走到Pincio的大門，那裡的小徑在一片修剪整齊的冬青樹下擴大為一個圓形空地，下面有一個噴泉和一條通往西班牙廣場的小徑。這個夜晚非常溫柔而安靜，在樹的深影下，只有冷酷的星星在照亮，空氣中除了噴泉的抽泣聲，別無他聲，她聽見一個男人的腳步聲從下面的碎石路上走來。</p>
<p>It was David Rossi. He passed within a few yards, yet he did not see
her. She wanted to call to him, but she could not do so. For a moment he
stood by the deep wall that overlooks the city, and then turned down the
path which she had come by. A trembling thought that was afraid to take
shape held her back and kept her silent, but the stars beat kindly in an
instant and the blood in her veins ran warm. She watched him from where
she stood, and then with a light foot she followed him at a distance.</p><p>那是大衛·羅西。他在幾碼之內就經過了，但他沒有看到她。她想叫住他，但卻無法做到。他在俯瞰城市的深牆旁停留了一會兒，然後沿著她來的小徑走了下去。一個害怕形成的顫抖的想法把她留在了原地，讓她保持沉默，但瞬間星光卻溫柔地拍打，她的血液又變得溫熱起來。她站在那裡看著他，然後輕盈的腳步隔著一段距離跟在他的後面。</p>
<p>It was true! He stopped at the parapet before the church, and looked up
at her windows. There was a light in one of them, and his eyes seemed to
be steadfastly fixed on it. Then he turned to go down the steps. He went
down slowly, sometimes stopping and looking up, then going on again.
Once more she tried to call to him. "Mr. Rossi." But her voice seemed to
die in her throat. After a moment he was gone, the houses had hidden
him, and the church clock was striking twelve.</p><p>真的！他在教堂前的欄杆處停下，抬頭看向她的窗戶。其中一扇窗戶亮著燈，他的眼睛似乎堅定地盯著它。然後他轉身走下樓梯。他走得很慢，有時會停下來再抬頭看，然後再繼續走。她再一次試圖呼喚他："羅西先生。"但她的聲音好像被喉嚨卡住了。片刻之後，他消失了，被房屋遮住了，教堂的鐘正敲著十二點。</p>
<p>When she returned to her bedroom and looked at herself in the glass, her
face was flushed and her eyes were sparkling. She did not want to sleep
at all that night, for the beating of her heart was like music, and the
moon and stars were singing a song.</p><p>當她回到自己的臥室，對著鏡子看自己時，臉龐潮紅，眼睛閃爍著光芒。那晚她一點也不想睡覺，因為心跳的節奏就像音樂，月亮和星星都在唱歌。</p>
<p>"If I could only be quite, quite sure!" she thought, and next morning
she tackled Bruno.</p><p>"如果我能完全完全確定!"她想，第二天早上她找上了布魯諾。</p>
<p>Bruno was no match for her now, but he put down his shaggy head, like a
bull facing a stone fence.</p><p>布魯諾現在無法與她匹敵，但他像面對石牆的公牛一樣，低下了他毛茸茸的頭。</p>
<p>"Tell you the honest truth, Donna Roma," he said, "Mr. Rossi is one of
those who think that when a man has taken up a work for the world it is
best if he has no ties of family."</p><p>"誠實地告訴你，羅馬當娜,"他說，"羅西先生是那種人，認為當一個人為了世界承擔工作時，最好沒有家庭的牽絆。"</p>
<p>"Really? Is that so?" she answered. "But I don't understand. He can't
help having father and mother, can he?"</p><p>"真的嗎？是這樣嗎？” 她回答道，“但我不明白。他不能選擇父母，對吧？”</p>
<p>"He can help having a wife, though," said Bruno, "and Mr. Rossi thinks a
public man should be like a priest, giving up home and love and so
forth, that others may have them more abundantly."</p><p>"他可以娶個妻子，"布魯諾說，"但是羅西先生認為，公眾人物應該像神父一樣，放棄家庭和愛情等等，以便讓其他人更充分地享有這些。"</p>
<p>"So for that reason...."<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00131" title="99"><a id="Page_99" title="99"></a></span></p><p>所以出於那個原因......</p>
<p>"For that reason he doesn't throw himself in the way of temptation."</p><p>因此，他不讓自己陷入誘惑之中。</p>
<p>"And you think that's why...."</p><p>而你認為這就是為什麼....</p>
<p>"I think that's why he keeps out of the way of women."</p><p>我認為這就是他為什麼避開女性的原因。</p>
<p>"Perhaps he doesn't care for them—some men don't, you know."</p><p>也許他並不在乎他們，你知道的，有些男人就是這樣。</p>
<p>"Care for them! Mr. Rossi is one of the men who think pearls and
diamonds of women, and if he had to be cast on a desert island with
anybody, he would rather have one woman than a hundred thousand men."</p><p>照顧她們！羅西先生是那種認為女人就是珍珠與鑽石的人，如果他不得不被困在荒島上，他寧願與一個女人共渡難關，也不願與十萬個男人同在。</p>
<p>"Ah, yes, but perhaps there's no 'one woman' in the world for him yet,
Bruno."</p><p>"啊，是的，但也許世界上還沒有他的'唯一的女人'，布魯諾。"</p>
<p>"Perhaps there is, perhaps there isn't," said Bruno, and his hammer fell
on the chisel and the white sparks began to fly.</p><p>"也許有，也許沒有，"布魯諾說，他的錘子落在鑿子上，白色的火花開始飛揚。</p>
<p>"<i>You</i> would soon see if there were, wouldn't you, Bruno?"</p><p>"你很快就會看到，若果真有的話，對吧，布魯諾？"</p>
<p>"Perhaps I would, perhaps I wouldn't," said Bruno, and then he wagged
his wise head and growled, "In the battle of love he wins who flies."</p><p>"也許我會，也許我不會，"布魯諾說，然後他聰明地搖搖頭，低聲咆哮，"在愛之戰中，逃跑的人才能獲勝。"</p>
<p>"Does <i>he</i> say that, Bruno?"</p><p>他有說那個嗎，布魯諾？</p>
<p>"He does. One day our old woman was trying to lead him on a bit. 'A
heart to share your joys and sorrows is something in this world,' says
she."</p><p>他確實如此。有一天，我們的老婦人試圖引導他一些。她說：“在這個世界上，有一顆可以分擔你的喜怒哀樂的心是很重要的。”</p>
<p>"And what did Mr. Rossi say?"</p><p>羅西先生說了什麼？</p>
<p>"'A woman's love is the sweetest thing in the world,' he said; 'but if I
found myself caring too much for anybody I should run away.'"</p><p>"女人的愛是世界上最甜美的東西,"他說；"但如果我發現自己對任何人關心過度，我會選擇逃跑。"</p>
<p>"Did Mr. Rossi really say that, Bruno?"</p><p>羅西先生真的說過那個，布魯諾嗎？</p>
<p>"He did—upon my life he did!"</p><p>他真的做了—我發誓他真的做了！</p>
<p>Bruno had the air of a man who had achieved a moral victory, and Roma,
whose eyes were dancing with delight, wanted to fall on his stupid,
sulky face and kiss and kiss it.</p><p>布魯諾看起來像一個在道德上獲得勝利的人，而羅馬的眼睛則因為欣喜若狂而閃爍著光芒，她想撲到他那張生悶氣的、愚蠢的臉上，親親他。</p>
<p>During the afternoon of the day following, the Princess Bellini came in
with Don Camillo. "Here's Gi-gi!" she cried. "He comes to say there's to
be a meet of the foxhounds on the Campagna to-morrow. If you'd like to
come I'll take you, and if you think Mr. Rossi will come too...."</p><p>在第二天的下午，貝利尼公主和唐卡米洛一起走了進來。她尖叫著說："這是吉吉！他來告訴我們明天在坎帕尼亞地區將會有獵狐犬的集合。如果你想來，我可以帶你，如果你認為羅西先生也會來......"</p>
<p>"If he rides and has time to spare," said Roma.</p><p>"如果他騎行並且有多餘的時間，" 羅馬說。</p>
<p>"Precisely," said Don Camillo. "The worst of being a prophet is that it
gives one so much trouble to agree with one's self, you know. Rumour
says that our illustrious Deputy has been a little out of odour with his
own people lately, and is now calling a meeting to tell the world what
his 'Creed<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00132" title="100"><a id="Page_100" title="100"></a></span> and Charter' doesn't mean. Still a flight into the country
might do no harm even to the stormy petrel of politics, and if any one
could prevail with him...."</p><p>"正確地說，"唐卡米洛說，"做預言家最糟糕的就是要搞定與自己的一致性給人帶來了很多麻煩，你知道。據傳我們崇高的代表最近與自己的人們關係疏遠，現在正召集一個會議來告訴世界他的'信念與憲章'並不意味著什麼。然而，即使對於政治風暴鳥來說，逃到鄉下也可能無傷大雅，如果有人能說服他...."</p>
<p>"Leave that to Roma, and see to everything else yourself," said the
Princess. "On the way to that tiresome tea-room in the Corso, my dear.
'Charity and Work,' you know. Committee for the protection of poor
girls, or something. But we must see the old aunt first, I suppose. Come
in, Gi-gi!"</p><p>“把那個交給羅馬處理，其餘的事情你自己看著辦，”公主說。“在去那個位於科索大道上令人煩惱的茶室的路上，親愛的。'慈善和工作'，你知道的。那是一個保護貧困女孩的委員會或者類似的東西。但我想我們必須先去看望老阿姨。進來，吉吉！”</p>
<p>Three minutes afterwards Roma was dressed for the street, and her dog
was leaping and barking beside her.</p><p>三分鐘後，羅馬已經打扮好出門，她的狗在她身旁跳躍並吠叫。</p>
<p>"Carriage, Eccellenza?"</p><p>馬車，閣下？</p>
<p>"Not to-day, thank you! Down, Black, down! Keep the dog from following
me, Felice."</p><p>"今天不用了，謝謝你！下去，黑嚕，下去！菲麗絲，阻止狗跟著我。"</p>
<p>As she passed the lodge the porter handed her an envelope bearing the
seal of the Minister, but she did not stop to open it. With a light step
she tripped along the street, hailed a <i>coupé</i>, cried "Piazza Navona,"
and then composed herself to read her letter.</p><p>當她走過小屋時，看門人遞給她一個帶有部長印章的信封，但她並未停下來打開它。她輕盈地踱步在街上，攔下一輛雙座馬車，大喊"納瓦爾納廣場"，然後安靜下來閱讀她的信。</p>
<p>When the Princess and Don Camillo came out of the Countess's room Roma
was gone, and the dog was scratching at the inside of the outer door.</p><p>當公主和唐卡米洛從伯爵夫人的房間走出來時，羅馬已經不見了，而狗正在外門內偮抓。</p>
<p>"Now where can she have gone to so suddenly, I wonder? And there's her
poor dog trying to follow her!"</p><p>她突然去哪裡了呢，我真不知道？還有她那可憐的狗正在試圖跟著她！</p>
<p>"Is that the dog that goes to the Deputy's apartment?"</p><p>那是去副議員公寓的那隻狗嗎？</p>
<p>"Certainly it is! His name is Black. I'll hold him while you open the
door, Felice. There! Good dog! Good Black! Oh, the brute, he has broken
away from me."</p><p>當然是！他的名字是黑色。Felice，我會在你開門時抱住他。好了！好狗！好黑色！哦，這個野獸，他已經從我這裡掙脫出來了。</p>
<p>"Black! Black! Black!"</p><p>黑！黑！黑！</p>
<p>"No use, Felice. He'll he half way through the streets by this time."</p><p>沒有用，Felice。他現在可能已經走到街道的一半了。</p>
<p>And going down the stairs the little Princess whispered to her
companion: "Now, if Black comes home with his mistress this evening it
will be easy to see where <i>she</i> has been."</p><p>小公主走下樓梯，對她的夥伴悄悄說："如果布萊克今晚與他的女主人一起回家，我們就容易看出她去過哪裡。"</p>
<p>Meantime Roma in her <i>coupé</i> was reading her letter—</p><p>同時，羅馬正在她的轎車裡閱讀她的信。</p>
<p style="padding-top:.5em;"><span class="smcap">"Dearest</span>,—Been away from Rome for a few days, and hence the delay in

<p>As the <i>coupé</i> turned into the Piazza Navona, Roma was tearing the
letter into shreds and casting them out of the window.</p><p>當轎車開進納沃納廣場時，羅馬正在將信撕成碎片，並從窗戶丟出去。</p>
<h3 id="pgepubid00134">VIII</h3>
<p>While Roma climbed the last flight of stairs to David Rossi's apartment,
with the slippery-sloppery footsteps of the old Garibaldian going before
her, Bruno's thunderous voice was rocking through the rooms above.</p><p>當羅馬爬上通往大衛·羅西公寓的最後一段樓梯時，舊加里波第人滑膩的腳步聲在她前面響起，布魯諾的雷鳴般的聲音正在上面的房間中回蕩。</p>
<p>"Look at him, Mr. Rossi! Republican, democrat, socialist, and rebel!
Upsets the government of this house once a day regularly—dethrones the
King and defies the Queen! Catch the piggy-wiggy, Uncle David! Here goes
for it—one, two, three, and away!"</p><p>看看他，羅西先生！無論是共和黨的、民主黨的、社會主義者還是反叛者！
他每天定時都會搞翻這個家的政府——推翻國王並挑戰皇后！抓住那隻小豬，大衛叔叔！一、二、三，我來了！</p>
<p>Then shrieks and squeals of childish laughter, mingled with another
man's gentler tones, and a woman's frightened remonstrance. And then
sudden silence and the voice of the Garibaldian in a panting whisper,
saying, "She's here again, sir!"</p><p>然後是孩子的尖叫和歡笑聲，夾雜著另一個男人更溫和的音調，以及一個女人驚恐的反對聲音。然後突然間安靜下來，只聽到加里波第的聲音氣喘吁吁地低語說，"她又來了，先生！"</p>
<p>"Donna Roma?"</p><p>羅馬的女士？</p>
<p>"Yes."</p><p>是</p>
<p>"Come in," cried David Rossi, and from the threshold of the open hall
she saw him, in the middle of the floor, with a little boy pitching and
heaving like a young sea-lion in his arms.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00135" title="102"><a id="Page_102" title="102"></a></span></p><p>"進來，"大衛·羅西大叫，從開放的大廳門檻上，她看見他站在地板中央，雙臂裡抱著一個小男孩，像一頭幼年的海獅一樣上下翻騰。</p>
<p>He slipped the boy to his feet and said, "Run to the lady and kiss her
hand, Joseph." But the boy stood off shyly, and, stepping into the room,
Roma knelt to the child and put her arms about him.</p><p>他讓男孩站到他的腳邊，然後說：“約瑟夫，跑去找那個女士，親吻她的手。”但是男孩害羞地站在一邊，羅馬走進房間，跪在男孩前，張開雙臂將他摟在懷裡。</p>
<p>"What a big little man, to be sure! His name is Joseph, is it? And
what's his age? Six! Think of that! Have I seen him before, Mrs. Rocco?
Yes? Perhaps he was here the day I called before? Was he? So? How stupid
of me to forget! Ah, of course, now I remember, he was in his
nightdress and asleep, and Mr. Rossi was carrying him to bed."</p><p>“真是個大小子啊！他的名字是約瑟夫嗎？他幾歲了？六歲！想想看！我以前見過他嗎，羅科夫人？
是的嗎？也許他在我上次來的時候就在這裡了？是這樣嗎？我竟然忘記了！啊，當然，現在我記起來了，他當時穿著睡衣睡覺，羅西先生正在把他抱去睡覺。”</p>
<p>The mother's heart was captured in a moment. "Do you love children,
Donna Roma?"</p><p>那位母親的心在一瞬間就被俘虜了。“你喜歡小孩子嗎，多納羅馬？”</p>
<p>"Indeed, I do!"</p><p>確實，我做了！</p>
<p>During this passage between the women Bruno had grunted his way out of
the room, and was now sidling down the staircase, being suddenly smitten
by his conscience with the memory of a message he had omitted to
deliver.</p><p>在這段時間裡，布魯諾在兩位女士之間嘔吐，他已經扭扭捏捏地離開了房間，現在正側身下樓梯。然後，他的良心突然被一個他忘記傳達的消息痛擊。</p>
<p>"Come, Joseph," said Elena. But Joseph, who had recovered from his
bashfulness, was in no hurry to be off, and Roma said:</p><p>“來吧，約瑟夫，"艾琳娜說。但是已經從害羞中恢復過來的約瑟夫並不急於離開，羅馬說：</p>
<p>"No, no! I've only called for a moment. It is to say," turning to David
Rossi, "that there's a meet of the foxhounds on the Campagna to-morrow,
and to tell you from Don Camillo that if you ride and would care to
go...."</p><p>"不，不！我只是打個電話過來。我要告訴你，"他轉向大衛·羅西，“明天在Campoagna會有一場獵狐犬的聚會，Don Camillo希望你如果會騎馬並且願意參加的話……"</p>
<p>"<i>You</i> are going?"</p><p>你要去嗎？</p>
<p>"With the Princess, yes! But there will be no necessity to follow the
hounds all day long, and perhaps coming home...."</p><p>與公主在一起，是的！但是沒有必要整天跟著獵犬，也許會回家 .....</p>
<p>"I will be there."</p><p>我會在那裡。</p>
<p>"How charming! That's all I came to say, and so...."</p><p>多麼迷人！我就是來說這句話，然後……</p>
<p>She made a pretence of turning to go, but he said:</p><p>她假裝要走，但他說：</p>
<p>"Wait! Now that you are here I have something to show to you."</p><p>等一下！現在你來了，我有些東西要給你看。</p>
<p>"To me?"</p><p>對我來說？</p>
<p>"Come in," he cried, and, blowing a kiss to the boy, Roma followed Rossi
into the sitting-room.</p><p>"進來,"他喊道， 吹了個吻給男孩， 羅馬跟著羅西進入了客廳。</p>
<p>"One moment," he said, and he left her to go into the bedroom.</p><p>「等一下，」他說，然後離開她去了臥室。</p>
<p>When he came back he had a small parcel in his hands wrapped in a lace
handkerchief.</p><p>當他回來時，他手中拿著一個用蕾絲手帕包裹的小包裹。</p>
<p>"We have talked so much of my old friend Roselli that I thought you
might like to see his portrait."<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00136" title="103"><a id="Page_103" title="103"></a></span></p><p>我們談了很多關於我的老朋友羅塞利，我想你可能會想看看他的肖像。</p>
<p>"His portrait? Have you really got his portrait?"</p><p>他的肖像畫？你真的有他的肖像畫嗎？</p>
<p>"Here it is," and he put into her hands the English photograph which
used to hang by his bed.</p><p>「這就是，」他把那張原本懸掛在他床邊的英格蘭照片遞到她手中。</p>
<p>She took it eagerly and looked at it steadfastly, while her lips
trembled and her eyes grew moist. There was silence for a moment, and
then she said, in a voice that struggled to control itself: "So this was
the father of little Roma?"</p><p>她熱切地接過，堅定地看著它，而她的嘴唇在顫抖，眼睛潮濕。一時之間，靜寂無聲。然後她以一種努力控制自己的聲音說道：“所以這就是小羅馬的父親？”</p>
<p>"Yes."</p><p>是</p>
<p>"Is it very like him?"</p><p>這非常像他嗎？</p>
<p>"Very."</p><p>非常</p>
<p>"What a beautiful face! What a reverend head! Did he look like that on
the day ... the day he was at Kensal Green?"</p><p>多麼美麗的臉龐！多麼莊重的頭部！他在那一天...在肯薩爾格林的那一天，他的樣子也是如此嗎？</p>
<p>"Exactly."</p><p>確切地說。</p>
<p>The excitement she laboured under could no longer be controlled, and she
lifted the picture to her lips and kissed it. Then catching her breath,
and looking up at him with swimming eyes, she laughed through her tears
and said:</p><p>她那無法抑制的激動情緒溢於言表，她將畫片抬至嘴唇親吻。然後屏住呼吸，帶著含淚的眼睛看向他，咧嘴含著淚水笑了笑，然後說道：</p>
<p>"That is because he was your friend, and because ... because he loved my
little namesake."</p><p>那是因為他是你的朋友，也因為...因為他愛我的小名字兒。</p>
<p>David Rossi did not reply, and the silence was too audible, so she said
with another nervous laugh:</p><p>大衛·羅西沒有回答，那沉默過於響亮，所以她帶著另一次緊張的笑聲說:</p>
<p>"Not that I think she deserved such a father. He must have been the best
father a girl ever had, but she...."</p><p>並非我認為她應該擁有這樣的父親。他一定是個女兒心中最好的父親，但她...</p>
<p>"She was a child," said David Rossi.</p><p>“她是個孩子，”大衛·羅西說。</p>
<p>"Still, if she had been worthy of a father like that...."</p><p>然而，如果她配得上像那樣的父親....</p>
<p>"She was only seven, remember."</p><p>她只有七歲，記得。</p>
<p>"Even so, but if she had not been a little selfish ... wasn't she a
little selfish?"</p><p>即使如此，但如果她沒有那麼自私...她不是有點自私嗎？</p>
<p>"You mustn't abuse my friend Roma."</p><p>你不應該虐待我的朋友羅馬。</p>
<p>Her eyes beamed, her cheeks burned, her nerves tingled. It would be a
sweet delight to egg him on, but she dare not go any farther.</p><p>她的眼睛閃著光，臉頰燃燒，神經振動。想要挑釁他對她來說將會是一種甜蜜的快感，但她不敢再往前走。</p>
<p>"I beg your pardon," she said in a soft voice. "Of course you know best.
And perhaps years afterward when she came to think of what her father
had been to her ... that is to say if she lived..."</p><p>"請原諒我，"她輕聲說，"當然你最清楚。也許多年後，當她回想起父親對她的意義...也就是說，如果她還活著的話... "</p>
<p>Their eyes met again, and now hers fell in confusion.</p><p>他們的目光再次交匯，而她的目光則在困惑中落下。</p>
<p>"I want to give you that portrait," he said.</p><p>"我想給你那幅肖像畫,"他說。</p>
<p>"Me?"</p><p>我？</p>
<p>"You would like to have it?"</p><p>您想要它嗎？</p>
<p>"More than anything in the world. But you value it yourself?"<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00137" title="104"><a id="Page_104" title="104"></a></span></p><p>比世界上的任何事情都重要。但是你自己珍視它嗎？</p>
<p>"Beyond anything I possess."</p><p>超越我所擁有的一切。</p>
<p>"Then how can I take it from you?"</p><p>那我該如何從你那裡拿走呢？</p>
<p>"There is only one person in the world I would give it to. She has it,
and I am contented."</p><p>世界上我只想把它給一個人。她已經擁有它了，我感到滿足。</p>
<p>It was impossible to hear the strain any longer without crying out, and
to give physical expression to her feelings she lifted the portrait to
her lips again and kissed and kissed it.</p><p>再也無法聽下去那壓力而不尖叫，要用身體動作表達她的情感，她再次將肖像提升到唇邊，並一次次親吻它。</p>
<p>He smiled at her, she smiled back; the silence was hard to break, but
just as they were on the edge of the precipice the big shock-head of the
little boy looked in on them through the chink of the door and cried:</p><p>他向她微笑，她也回以微笑；沉默的氣氛非常難以打破，然而就在他們位於懸崖的邊緣時，那個小男孩的大頭在門縫中探出來對他們喊道：</p>
<p>"You needn't ask me to come in, 'cause I won't!"</p><p>你不必要求我進來，因為我不會！</p>
<p>By the blessed instinct of the motherhood latent in her, Roma understood
the boy in a moment. "If I were a gentleman, I would, though," she said.</p><p>由於她身上潛藏的母性本能，羅馬在瞬間理解了這個男孩。"如果我是個紳士,我會這麼做的,"她說。</p>
<p>"<i>Would</i> you?" said Joseph, and in he came, with a face shining all
over.</p><p>“你會嗎？”約瑟夫問，然後他走了進來，臉上洋溢著燦爛的光芒。</p>
<p>"Hurrah! A piano!" said Roma, leaping up and seating herself at the
instrument. "What shall I play for you, Joseph?"</p><p>"萬歲！一架鋼琴！"羅馬跳起身，坐在樂器前。"我應該為你彈什麼，約瑟夫？"</p>
<p>Joseph was indifferent so long as it was a song, and with head aside,
Roma touched the keys and pretended to think. After a moment of sweet
duplicity she struck up the air she had come expressly to play.</p><p>約瑟夫對於是否是一首歌不感興趣，只要有歌聲就好，而羅馬則把頭偏向一邊，輕觸琴鍵，佯裝在思考。經過一段甜蜜的欺騙後，她開始演奏特意來彈的那首樂曲。</p>
<p>It was the "British Grenadiers." She sang a verse of it. She sang in
English and with the broken pronunciation of a child—</p><p>那是"英國擲彈兵之歌"。她唱了一段。她用英語唱，像孩子一樣的發音不準。</p>
<p style="margin-left:2em">
"Some talk of Allisander, and some of Hergoles;<br/>
Of Hector and Eyesander, and such gate names as these..."<br/>
</p><p style="margin-left:2em">“有人談論阿利桑德，也有人提到赫爾高勒斯；
有關赫克託和艾耶桑德的琅琅上口的名字..."</p>
<p>Suddenly she became aware that David Rossi was looking at her through
the glass on the mantel-piece, and to keep herself from crying she began
to laugh, and the song came to an end.</p><p>她突然意識到，大衛·羅西正在透過壁爐架上的玻璃看著她，為了阻止自己哭泣，她開始笑起來，歌曲也隨之結束。</p>
<p>At the same moment the door burst open with a bang, and the dog came
bounding into the room. Behind it came Elena, who said:</p><p>就在那一刻，門砰地一聲被推開，狗兒蹦蹦跳跳地跑進了房間。在它後面是伊萊娜，她說：</p>
<p>"It was scratching at the staircase door, and I thought it must have
followed you."</p><p>它正在樓梯口的門上抓，我以為它一定是跟著你來的。</p>
<p>"Followed Mr. Rossi, you mean. He has stolen my dog's heart away from
me," said Roma.</p><p>"你的意思是說我跟隨羅西先生，他已經偷走了我的狗的心，"羅馬說。</p>
<p>"That is what I say about my boy's," said Elena.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00138" title="105"><a id="Page_105" title="105"></a></span></p><p>“那就是我對我孩子的看法，”Elena說。</p>
<p>"But Joseph is going for a soldier, I see."</p><p>但是我看到約瑟夫要去當兵了。</p>
<p>"It's a porter he wants to be."</p><p>他想成為一個搬運工。</p>
<p>"Then so he shall—he shall be my porter some day," said Roma, whereupon
Joseph was frantic with delight, and Elena was saying to herself, "What
wicked lies they tell of her—I wonder they are not ashamed!"</p><p>"那麼他將會—有一天他將會成為我的服務員。” 羅馬這麼說之後，約瑟夫欣喜若狂，而艾琳娜在心裡對自己說，“他們對她講的壞話真是惡毒—我真懷疑他們怎麼不覺得羞恥！"</p>
<p>The fire was going down and the twilight was deepening.</p><p>火光正在熄滅，暮色逐漸加深。</p>
<p>"Shall I bring you the lamp, sir?" said Elena.</p><p>"我該為您拿燈來嗎，先生?" 伊琳娜說。</p>
<p>"Not for me," said Roma. "I am going immediately." But even when mother
and child had gone she did not go. Unconsciously they drew nearer and
nearer to each other in the gathering darkness, and as the daylight died
their voices softened and there were quiet questions and low replies.
The desire to speak out was struggling in the woman's heart with the
delight of silence. But she would reveal herself at last.</p><p>"不是我，"羅馬說，"我馬上就走了。" 但即使母親和小孩已經離去，她仍然未走。無意識地，他們在日漸黯淡的黑暗中互相靠近。隨著日光消失，他們的聲音變得柔和，有安靜的問題和低聲的回答。渴望說出心聲的慾望正在女人的心中與寧靜的喜悅相爭。但她終究會表露自己。</p>
<p>"I have been thinking a great deal about the story they told you in
London—of Roma's death and burial, I mean. Had you no reason to think
it might be false?"</p><p>我一直在思考他們在倫敦告訴你的故事——我指的是關於羅馬的死亡和葬禮的事。你有沒有什麼理由認為這可能是假的？</p>
<p>"None whatever."</p><p>完全沒有</p>
<p>"It never occurred to you that it might be to anybody's advantage to say
that she was dead while she was still alive?"</p><p>你從未想過，當她尚未逝世時說她已經去世，可能對任何人都有利嗎？</p>
<p>"How could it? Who was to perpetrate a crime for the sake of the
daughter of a poor doctor in Soho—a poor prisoner in Elba?"</p><p>"怎麼可能呢？有誰會為了蘇活區一位窮困醫生的女兒，為了在厄爾巴島的一位囚犯去犯罪呢？"</p>
<p>"Then it was not until afterward that you heard that the poor doctor was
a great prince?"</p><p>"那麼，直到後來你才聽說那個可憐的醫生其實是一位偉大的王子嗎？"</p>
<p>"Not until the night you were here before."</p><p>直到你之前來的那個夜晚。</p>
<p>"And you had never heard anything of his daughter in the interval?"</p><p>"在此期間，您從未聽說過他的女兒的任何事情嗎？"</p>
<p>"Once I had! It was on the same day, though. A man came here from London
on an infamous errand..."</p><p>曾經有一次！就在同一天，有個從倫敦來的男人，帶著一個惡名昭彰的任務來到這裡...</p>
<p>"What was his name?"</p><p>他的名字是什麼？</p>
<p>"Charles Minghelli."</p><p>查爾斯·明格利</p>
<p>"What did he say?"</p><p>他說了什麼？</p>
<p>"He said Roma Roselli was not dead at all, but worse than dead—that she
had fallen into the hands of an evil man, and turned out badly."</p><p>他說羅馬羅賽利並未死去，但卻比死還要更糟。她落入了一個邪惡男子的手中，結果變得非常糟糕。</p>
<p>"Did you ... did you believe that story?"</p><p>你…你相信那個故事嗎？</p>
<p>"Not one word of it! I called the man a liar, and flung him out of the
house."</p><p>"一字也沒有！我稱那個男人為騙子，並把他從房子裡趕出去。"</p>
<p>"Then you ... you think ... if she is still living...."</p><p>那麼你...你認為...如果她還在生活....</p>
<p>"My Roma is a good woman."</p><p>我的羅馬是一個好女人。</p>
<p>Her face burned up to the roots of her hair. She choked<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00139" title="106"><a id="Page_106" title="106"></a></span> with joy, she
choked with pain. His belief in her purity stifled her. She could not
speak now—she could not reveal herself. There was a moment of silence,
and then in a tremulous voice she said:</p><p>她的臉紅到了髮根處。她既因喜悅而哽咽，又因痛苦而窒息。他對她純潔的信任讓她感到窒息。她現在不能說話了——她不能揭示自己。一陣寂靜之後，她帶著顫抖的聲音說道：</p>
<p>"Will you not call <i>me</i> Roma, and try to think I am your little friend?"</p><p>你不會叫我羅馬，並試著想像我是你的小朋友嗎？</p>
<p>When she came to herself after that she was back in her own apartment,
in her aunt's bedroom, and kissing the old lady's angular face. And the
Countess was breaking up the stupefaction of her enchantment with sighs
and tears and words of counsel.</p><p>當她恢復知覺後，她回到了自己的公寓，身在姑姑的臥室裡，親吻著那位老奶奶線條嚴謹的臉龐。而伯爵夫人則是以嘆息、淚水和勸告的話語打斷了她昏沉的迷惑。</p>
<p>"I only want you to preserve yourself for your proper destiny, Roma. You
are the <i>fiancée</i> of the Baron, as one might say, and the poor maniac
can't last long."</p><p>我只希望你能夠為了你正確的命運而保留自己，羅馬。可以說，你是男爵的未婚妻，那個可憐的瘋子無法撐多久。</p>
<p>Before dressing for dinner Roma replied to the Minister:—</p><p>在打扮晚宴之前，羅馬回覆了部長：</p>
<p style="padding-top:.5em;">"<span class="smcap">Dear Baron Bonelli</span>,—Didn't I tell you that Minghelli would find out
nothing? I am now more than ever sure that the whole idea is an error.
Take my advice and drop it. Drop it! Drop it! I shall, at all
events!—Yours,</p><p style="padding-top:.5em;">尊敬的波內利男爵，我不是告訴過你明格利會無法找到任何東西嗎？現在，我比以往更確定整個想法都是一個錯誤。請接受我的建議，放手吧！放手吧！放手吧！無論如何，我將這麼做！-你的</p>
<p style="text-align:right; margin-top:-1em;">"<span class="smcap">Roma Volonna</span>.</p><p style="text-align:right; margin-top:-1em;">羅馬沃洛納</p>
<p style="padding-bottom:.5em;">"Success to the dinner! Am sending Felice. He will give you this
letter.—R. V."</p><p style="padding-bottom:.5em;">祝晚餐成功！我正在派Felice給你。他會把這封信交給你。—R. V.</p>
<h3 id="pgepubid00140">IX</h3>
<p>It was the sweetest morning of the Roman winter. The sun shone with a
gentle radiance, and the motionless air was fragrant with the odour of
herbs and flowers. Outside the gate which leads to the old Appian Way
grooms were waiting with horses, blanketed and hooded, and huntsmen in
red coats, white breeches, pink waistcoats, and black boots, were
walking their mounts to the place appointed for the meet. In a line of
carriages were many ladies, some in riding-habits, and on foot there was
a string of beggars, most of them deformed, with here and there, at
little villages, a group of rosy children watching the procession as it
passed.</p><p>那是羅馬冬天最甜蜜的早晨。太陽以溫柔的光芒照耀，靜止的空氣中充滿了草本植物和花朵的香氣。在通往古老的阿皮安路的門外，馬伕們正在等待，馬兒被覆蓋並戴上帽子，而身穿紅色外套、白色短褲、粉紅色馬甲和黑色靴子的獵人們正在將他們的座騎走向預定的集合地點。一列車中有很多女士，有些身穿騎衣，而步行的則是一串乞丐，他們大多數都有身體缺陷，在一些小村莊裡，還有一群群面色紅潤的孩子們在觀看著這一 procession的行進。</p>
<p>The American and English Ambassadors were riding side by side behind a
magnificent carriage with coachman and tiger in livery of scarlet and
gold.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00141" title="107"><a id="Page_107" title="107"></a></span></p><p>美國與英國的大使並排騎著馬，跟隨在一輛華麗的馬車後面，馬車上的司機和侍童都穿著猩紅色和金色的制服。</p>
<p>"Who would think, to look on a scene like this, that the city is
seething with dissatisfaction?" said the Englishman.</p><p>"誰會想到，看著這樣的景象，城市卻充滿了不滿呢？"英國人說。</p>
<p>"Rome?" said the American. "Its aristocratic indifference will not allow
it to believe that here, as everywhere else in the world, great and
fatal changes are going on all the time. These lands, for example—to
whom do they belong? Nominally to the old Roman nobility, but really to
the merchants of the Campagna—a company of middlemen who grew rich by
leasing them from the princes and subletting them to the poor."</p><p>"羅馬？"美國人說。「它貴族般的冷漠無法讓它相信，這裡，像世界上其他任何地方一樣，都有著巨大且致命的變化一直在發生。譬如這些土地——它們歸屬於誰？名義上是舊有的羅馬貴族，但實際上是屬於坎帕尼亞商人——一群透過從王子手中租賃土地並將其轉租給窮人而發富的中間商。」</p>
<p>"And the nobles themselves—how are they faring?"</p><p>那些貴族們自己——他們過得如何？</p>
<p>"Badly! Already they are of no political significance, and the State
knows them not."</p><p>糟糕！他們已經沒有任何政治影響力，而國家並不認識他們。</p>
<p>"They don't appear to go into the army or navy—what do they go into?"</p><p>他們似乎不去軍隊或海軍──那他們到底選擇去哪裡呢？</p>
<p>"Love!"</p><p>愛！</p>
<p>"And meantime the Italian people?"</p><p>那麼，義大利人民呢？</p>
<p>"Meantime the great Italian people, like the great English people, the
great German people, and the people of every country where the
privileged classes still exist, are rising like a mighty wave to sweep
all this sea-wrack high and dry on to the rocks."</p><p>與此同時，偉大的義大利人民，如同偉大的英國人民，偉大的德國人民，以及在任何享有特權階級仍存在的國家的人民，都如同一股強大的海浪般崛起，將所有這些海中的雜物衝刷上岩石，讓它們擱淺在岸上。</p>
<p>"And this wave of the people," said the Englishman, inclining his head
toward the carriage in front, "is represented by men like friend Rossi?"</p><p>"這股人民的浪潮，"英國人說，他的頭微微點向前面的馬車，"是由像羅西朋友這樣的人所代表的嗎?"</p>
<p>"Would be, if he could keep himself straight," said the American.</p><p>"如果他能保持正直，那就會是的，"美國人說。</p>
<p>"And where is the Tarpeian rock of friend Rossi's politics?"</p><p>那麼，羅西朋友政治中的塔爾佩安岩石在哪裡？</p>
<p>The American slapped his glossy boot with his whip, lowered his voice,
and said, "There!"</p><p>美國人用鞭子拍打他亮澤的靴子，降低了他的聲音，然後說："就是這裡！"</p>
<p>"Donna Roma?"</p><p>"羅馬的女人?"</p>
<p>"A fortnight ago you heard his speech on the liveries of scarlet and
gold, and look! He's under them himself already."</p><p>"兩週前，你聽到他講關於鮮紅與金色制服的演說，看！他自己已經穿上這些制服了。"</p>
<p>"You think there is no other inference?"</p><p>你認為沒有其他的推論嗎？</p>
<p>The American shook his head. "Always the way with these leaders of
revolution. It's Samson's strength with Samson's weakness in every
mother's son of them."</p><p>那位美國人搖了搖頭。"對於這些革命領導者，總是這種情況。他們每一個人都有著參孫的力量，但也有參孫的弱點。"</p>
<p>"Good-morning, General Potter!" said a cheerful voice from the carriage
in front.</p><p>"早安，波特將軍！"一個快樂的聲音從前面的馬車裡傳來。</p>
<p>It was Roma herself. She sat by the side of the little Princess, with
David Rossi on the seat before them. Her<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00142" title="108"><a id="Page_108" title="108"></a></span> eyes were bright, there was a
glow in her cheeks, and she looked lovelier than ever in her
close-fitting riding-habit.</p><p>那就是羅馬本人。她坐在小公主的旁邊，大衛·羅西坐在他們前面的座位上。她的眼睛明亮，面頰上有光澤，穿著緊身的騎術裝，她看起來比以往任何時候都更美。</p>
<p>At the meeting-place there was a vast crowd of on-lookers, chiefly
foreigners, in cabs and carriages and four-in-hand coaches from the
principal hotels. The Master of the Hunt was ready, with his impatient
hounds at his feet, and around him was a brilliant scene. Officers in
blue, huntsmen in red, ladies in black, jockeys in jackets, a sea of
feathers and flowers and sunshades, with the neighing of the horses and
yapping of the dogs, the vast undulating country, the smell of earth and
herbs, and the morning sunlight over all.</p><p>在集合地點，有大量的觀眾，主要是外國人，他們從主要的酒店乘坐出租車、馬車和四人馬車來此。狩獵團隊的領導者已經準備好，他的腳下是不耐煩的獵犬，他周圍是一個璀璨的景象。身穿藍色制服的軍官，紅衣的獵人，黑衣的女士，穿著賽馬服的騎師，一片由羽毛，花朵和陽傘組成的海洋，馬兒的嘶鳴聲和狗的叫聲，在廣闊的起伏的鄉間，土壤和草本植物的香氣，以及覆蓋在一切上的晨曦陽光。</p>
<p>Don Camillo was waiting with horses for his party, and they mounted
immediately. The horse for Roma was a quiet bay mare with limpid eyes.
General Potter helped her to the saddle, and she went cantering through
the long lush grass.</p><p>當卡米洛正等待他的團隊帶著馬匹，他們立刻就騎上馬。羅馬的馬匹是一匹平靜的黃騮瞪著清澈的眼睛。波特將軍幫她上了馬鞍，她接著在長長的茂密草地上疾馳。</p>
<p>"What has your charming young charge been doing with herself, Princess?"
said the American. "She was always beautiful, but to-day she's lovely."</p><p>"您那迷人的小姑娘最近在做什麼呢，公主？" 美國人說。"她一直都很美，但今天她更是可愛。”</p>
<p>"She's like Undine after she had found her soul," said the Englishman.</p><p>"她就像找到了靈魂的翁迪恩,"那位英國人說。</p>
<p>The little Princess laughed. "Love and a cough cannot be hidden,
gentlemen," she whispered, with a look toward David Rossi.</p><p>小公主笑了起來，她低聲對著大衛·羅西說：“先生們，愛情和咳嗽是無法藏起來的。”</p>
<p>"You don't mean...."</p><p>你不是說......</p>
<p>"Hush!"</p><p>噓！</p>
<p>Meantime Rossi, in ordinary walking dress, was approaching the horse he
was intended to ride. It was a high strong-limbed sorrel with wild eyes
and panting nostrils. The English groom who held it was regarding the
rider with a doubtful expression, and a group of booted and spurred
huntsmen were closing around.</p><p>與此同時，羅西身著普通的行走服走向他要騎的馬。它是一匹高大、健壯、肢體強壯的栗色馬，眼睛狂野，鼻孔急促地喘息。拿著它的英國馬伕帶著疑惑的表情看著騎馬者，一群穿靴戴刺的獵人正在逼近。</p>
<p>To everybody's surprise, the deputy gathered up the reins and leaped
lightly to the saddle, and at the next moment he was riding at Roma's
side. Then the horn was sounded, the pack broke into music, the horses
beat their hoofs on the turf and the hunt began.</p><p>令所有人驚訝的是，副警長快速拿起馬韁，輕盈地躍上馬鞍，下一刻他已經在羅馬的身邊騎行。然後，號角聲響起，馬群嘶鳴如歌，馬蹄在草地上跺擊，狩獵開始了。</p>
<p>There was a wall to jump first, and everybody cleared it easily until it
came to David Rossi's turn, when the sorrel refused to jump. He patted
the horse's neck and tried it again, but it shied and went off with its
head between its legs. A third time he brought the sorrel up to the
wall, and a third time it swerved aside.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00143" title="109"><a id="Page_109" title="109"></a></span></p><p>首先有一堵要跳過的牆，每個人都輕而易舉地跳過，直到輪到大衛·羅西時，那匹栗色的馬拒絕跳躍。他輕拍馬的脖子並再次嘗試，但馬卻驚縮並頭低著腿間跑開了。他第三次帶著這匹栗色的馬向牆壁跑去，但馬又第三次閃開了。</p>
<p>The hunters had waited to watch the result, and as the horse came up for
a fourth trial, with its wild eyes flashing, its nostrils quivering, and
its forelock tossed over one ear, it was seen that the bridle had broken
and Rossi was riding with one rein.</p><p>獵人們等待觀察結果，而當那匹馬來進行第四次嘗試時，它那野性的眼睛閃爍著，鼻孔在顫抖，前額的鬃毛蔽過了一隻耳朵，顯然看出馬勒已經斷裂，羅西只用一條韁繩騎著。</p>
<p>"He'll be lucky if he isn't hurt," said some one.</p><p>"如果他沒有受傷，那他真的很幸運，"有人說。</p>
<p>"Why doesn't he give it the whip over its quarters?" said another.</p><p>"他為什麼不對它的後腿用鞭子呢？" 另一個人說。</p>
<p>But David Rossi only patted his horse until it came to the spot where it
had shied before. Then he reached over its neck on the side of the
broken rein, and with open hand struck it sharply across the nose. The
horse reared, snorted, and jumped, and at the next moment it was
standing quietly on the other side of the wall.</p><p>但是大衛·羅西只是輕拍他的馬，直到它來到之前驚退的地方。然後他越過馬頸的那一側，用開掌的手猛烈地打在它的鼻子上。馬立刻驚起，吭喊著跳躍起來，而下一刻，它就安靜地站在牆的另一邊。</p>
<p>Roma, on her bay mare, was ashen pale, and the American Ambassador
turned to her and said:</p><p>羅馬騎在她的棕色母馬上，臉色蒼白如灰，然後美國大使轉向她，說道：</p>
<p>"Never knew but one man to do a thing like that, Donna Roma."</p><p>"我只知道有一個男人會做這種事，唐娜·羅馬。"</p>
<p>Roma swallowed something in her throat and said: "Who was it, General
Potter?"</p><p>洛瑪喉嚨裡嚥了一口口水，問道："是誰，波特將軍?"</p>
<p>"The present Pope when he was a Noble Guard."</p><p>當今教皇在他擔任貴族衛隊時。</p>
<p>"He can ride, by Jove!" said Don Camillo.</p><p>“他能騎馬，真是太神了！”唐卡米洛說。</p>
<p>"That sort of stuff has to be in a man's blood. Born in him—must be!"
said the Englishman.</p><p>"這種東西必須深深鎖在一個男人的血液中，天生就有的，一定是如此!" 英國人說道。</p>
<p>And then David Rossi came up with a new bridle to his sorrel, and Sir
Evelyn added: "You handle a horse like a man who began early, Mr.
Rossi."</p><p>然後大衛·羅西為他的棕色馬匹配上新的馬勒，埃弗林爵士接著說：“羅西先生，你處理馬匹的方式就像一位早年就開始的馬夫。”</p>
<p>"Yes," said David Rossi; "I was a stable-boy two years in New York, your
Excellency."</p><p>"是的，"大衛·羅西說，"我在紐約當了兩年的馬廄男孩，閣下。"</p>
<p>At that moment the huntsman who was leading with two English terriers
gave the signal that the fox was started, whereupon the hounds yelped,
the whips whistled, and the horses broke into a canter.</p><p>就在那一刻，帶著兩隻英國獵犬的獵人給出了狐狸已經開始逃走的訊號。隨著這個訊號，獵狗開始吠叫，鞭子揮舞著颳出了風，而馬匹則開始慢跑。</p>
<p>Two hours afterwards the poor little creature that had been the origin
of the holiday was tracked to earth and killed. Its head and tail were
cut off, and the rest of its body was thrown to the dogs. After that
flasks were taken out, healths were drunk, cheers were given, and then
the hunt broke up, and the hunters began to return at an easy trot.</p><p>兩小時後，那個引起假期的可憐小生物被追蹤到了地面並被殺死。它的頭和尾巴被割下來，剩下的身體被扔給了狗。之後，他們拿出了酒瓶，舉杯祝壽，歡呼，然後獵犬解散，獵人開始悠閒地返回。</p>
<p>Roma and David Rossi were riding side by side, and the Princess was a
pace or two behind them.</p><p>洛馬和大衛·羅西並排騎行，公主則在他們後面一兩步距離。</p>
<p>"Roma!" cried the Princess, "what a stretch for a gallop!"<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00144" title="110"><a id="Page_110" title="110"></a></span></p><p>“羅馬！”公主喊道，“真是個適合疾馳的地方！”</p>
<p>"Isn't it?" said Roma, and in a moment she was off.</p><p>“不是嗎？”羅馬說，然後她立即離開了。</p>
<p>"I believe her mare has mastered her," said the Princess, and at the
next instant David Rossi was gone too.</p><p>“我相信她的母馬已經掌控了她，”公主說，下一刻，大衛·羅西也消失了。</p>
<p>"Peace be with them! They're a lovely pair!" said the Princess,
laughing. "But we might as well go home. They are like Undine, and will
return no more."</p><p>"願平安與他們同在！他們真是一對可愛的情侶！"公主笑著說，"但我們也許應該回家了。他們就像烏丁一樣，不會再回來了。"</p>
<h3 id="pgepubid00145">X</h3>
<p>Meantime, with the light breeze in her ears, and the beat of her horse's
hoofs echoing among the aqueducts and tombs, Roma galloped over the
broad Campagna. After a moment she heard some one coming after her, and
for joy of being pursued she whipped up and galloped faster. Without
looking back she knew who was behind, and as her horse flew over the
hillocks her heart leaped and sang. When the strong-limbed sorrel came
up with the quiet bay mare, they were nearly two miles from their
starting-place, and far out of the track of their fellow-hunters. Both
were aglow from head to foot, and as they drew rein they looked at each
other and laughed.</p><p>與此同時，她耳邊迴響著微風的聲音，馬蹄在水道和墓碑之間響起。羅馬跨過寬廣的坎帕尼亞平原急速賓士。片刻之後，她聽到有人在她後面追趕，為了激發被追趕的狂喜，她加快了速度。不回頭看，她已經知道誰在她身後，當她的馬在小丘間飛奔，她的心跳動起來，歌唱起來。當強壯的栗色馬跟上安靜的灣馬時，他們距離起點已經近兩英里，遠離了他們的獵人同伴的蹤跡。他們都從頭到腳發熱，當他們收起韁繩的時候，他們相互看著對方，然後笑了起來。</p>
<p>"Might as well go on now, and come out by the English cemetery," said
Roma.</p><p>"那麼現在就繼續前進，然後從英國公墓那裡出來吧，" 羅馬說。</p>
<p>"Good!" said David Rossi.</p><p>"好！"羅西大衛說。</p>
<p>"But it's half-past two," said Roma, looking at her little watch, "and
I'm as hungry as a hunter."</p><p>"但是現在已經兩點半了。"羅馬看著她的小手錶說，"我餓得像個獵人一樣。"</p>
<p>"Naturally," said David Rossi, and they laughed again. There was an
osteria somewhere in that neighbourhood. He had known it when he was a
boy. They would dine on yellow beans and macaroni.</p><p>"當然," 大衛·羅西說，他們再次大笑。那個鄰裡的某處有一家小酒館。他小的時候就知道它。他們將吃黃豆和通心粉作為晚餐。</p>
<p>Presently they saw a house smoking under a scraggy clump of eucalyptus.
It was the osteria, half farmstead and half inn. A timid lad took their
horses, an evil-looking old man bowed them into the porch, and an
elderly woman, with a frightened expression and a face wrinkled like the
bark of a cedar, brought them a bill of fare.</p><p>他們現在看到一棟房子在破破爛爛的桉樹叢下冒煙。那是一間酒館，一半是農舍，一半是旅館。一個膽小的男孩接過他們的馬，一個長相邪惡的老男人鞠躬引他們進入門廊，然後一個臉部表情恐慌，臉皮皺褶像雪松樹皮的老婦人把菜單帶給他們。</p>
<p>They laughed at everything—at the unfamiliar menu, because it was
soiled enough to have served for a year; at the food, because it was so
simple; and at the prices, because they were so cheap.</p><p>他們對所有事都笑——對那份陌生的菜單，因為它髒到足以被使用一年；對那些食物，因為它太簡單；還有對那些價格，因為它們實在太便宜。</p>
<p>Roma looked over David Rossi's shoulder as he read out the bill of fare,
and they ordered the dinner together.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00146" title="111"><a id="Page_111" title="111"></a></span></p><p>羅馬趴在大衛·羅西的肩膀上看他朗讀菜單，然後他們一起點了晚餐。</p>
<p>"Macaroni—threepence! Right! Trout—fourpence! Shall we have
fourpennyworth of trout? Good! Lamb—sixpence! We'll take two lambs—I
mean two sixpenny-worths," and then more laughter.</p><p>“通心粉—三便士！對！鱒魚—四便士！我們要不要買四便士的鱒魚？好！羔羊—六便士！我們要兩隻羔羊—我是說兩份六便士的，”然後，更多的笑聲。</p>
<p>While the dinner was cooking they went out to walk among the eucalyptus,
and came upon a beautiful dell surrounded by trees and carpeted with
wild flowers.</p><p>當晚餐正在烹製時，他們走出去在桉樹間漫步，並偶然發現一個被樹木環繞、鋪滿野花的美麗山谷。</p>
<p>"Carnival!" cried Roma. "Now if there was anybody here to throw a flower
at one!"</p><p>"嘉年華！" 羅馬大喊。"要是有人在這裡向我扔一朵花就好了！"</p>
<p>He picked up a handful of violets and tossed them over her head.</p><p>他拿起一把紫羅蘭，然後丟在她的頭上。</p>
<p>"When I was a boy this was where men fought duels," said David Rossi.</p><p>"當我還是個男孩的時候，這裡是男人進行決鬥的地方，"大衛·羅西說。</p>
<p>"The brutes! What a lovely spot! Must be the place where Pharaoh's
daughter found Moses in the bulrushes!"</p><p>野獸！多麼美麗的地方！這一定是法老王的女兒在蘆葦中找到摩西的地方！</p>
<p>"Or where Adam found Eve in the garden of Eden?"</p><p>或者亞當在伊甸園裡找到夏娃的地方?</p>
<p>They looked at each other and smiled.</p><p>他們相視而笑。</p>
<p>"What a surprise that must have been to him," said Roma. "Whatever did
he think she was, I wonder?"</p><p>"他一定覺得這很意外吧，" 羅馬說。"不知道他到底以為她是什麼呢？"</p>
<p>"An angel who had come down in the moonlight and forgotten to go up in
the morning!"</p><p>一位在月光下降臨的天使，卻在早晨忘記上升！</p>
<p>"Nonsense! He would know in a moment she was a woman."</p><p>胡說！他馬上就會知道她是女性。</p>
<p>"Think of it! She was the only woman in the world for him!"</p><p>想想看！對他來說，她是世界上唯一的女人！</p>
<p>"And fancy! He was the only man!"</p><p>而且想象一下！他是唯一的男人！</p>
<p>The dinner was one long delight. Even its drawbacks were no
disadvantage. The food was bad, and it was badly cooked and badly
served, but nothing mattered.</p><p>這頓晚餐是一長串的愉快。即使有其缺點，也無損於其樂趣。食物烹煮得很糟，服務也很差，但這一切都無關緊要。</p>
<p>"Only one fork for all these dishes?" asked David Rossi.</p><p>"只有一把叉子供所有這些菜餚使用嗎？"羅西大衛問。</p>
<p>"That's the best of it," said Roma. "You only get one dirty one."</p><p>"這就是最好的部分，"羅馬說。"你只會碰到一個骯髒的。"</p>
<p>Suddenly she dropped knife and fork, and held up both hands. "I forgot!"</p><p>她突然放下刀叉，雙手舉起。"我忘了!"</p>
<p>"What?"</p><p>什麼？</p>
<p>"I was to be little Roma all day to-day."</p><p>今天整天我都是小羅馬。</p>
<p>"Why, so you are, and so you have been."</p><p>為什麼，你就是這樣，你也一直是這樣。</p>
<p>"That cannot be, or you would call her by her name, you know."</p><p>那不可能，否則你就會直呼她的名字了。</p>
<p>"I'll do so the moment she calls me by mine."</p><p>她一叫我的名字，我就會這麼做。</p>
<p>"That's not fair," said Roma, and her face flushed up, for the wine of
life had risen to her eyes.</p><p>"那不公平，" 羅馬說，她的臉因為生活的酒漲至她的眼睛而變紅。</p>
<p>In a vineyard below a girl working among the orange trees<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00147" title="112"><a id="Page_112" title="112"></a></span> was singing
<i>stornelli</i>. It was a song of a mother to her son. He had gone away from
the old roof-tree, but he would come back some day. His new home was
bright and big, but the old hearthstone would draw him home. Beautiful
ladies loved him, but the white-haired mother would kiss him again.</p><p>在一個葡萄園的下方，一位女孩正在橙樹間工作，她在唱著stornelli。這是一首母親對兒子的歌。他已經離開了老家，但有一天他會回來。他的新家又大又亮，但老家的壁爐會把他拉回家。美麗的女士們愛著他，但白頭髮的母親會再次親吻他。</p>
<p>They listened for a short dreaming space, and their laughter ceased and
their eyes grew moist. Then they called for the bill, and the old man
with the evil face came up with a forced smile from a bank that had
clearly no assets of that kind to draw upon.</p><p>他們在短暫的夢境中靜靜傾聽，他們的笑聲停止，眼中充滿了溼潤。然後他們呼喚結帳，那個邪惡面孔的老人硬擠出一絲笑容，顯然那裡沒有任何他可以提取的資產。</p>
<p>"You've been a long time in this house, landlord," said David Rossi.</p><p>"你在這棟房子裡待了很久了，房東，"大衛·羅西說。</p>
<p>"Very long time, Excellency," said the man.</p><p>“好長時間了，閣下。”那個男人說。</p>
<p>"You came from the Ciociaria."</p><p>你來自奇奧夏裡亞。</p>
<p>"Why, yes, I did," said the man, with a look of surprise. "I was poor
then, and later on I lived in the caves and grottoes of Monte Parioli."</p><p>"為什麼，是的，我確實這麼做了，"那個男人帶著驚訝的表情說。"我那時候很窮，之後我在蒙特帕裡奧利的洞穴和巖洞裡生活。"</p>
<p>"But you knew how to cure the phylloxera in the vines, and when your
master died you married his daughter and came into his vineyard."</p><p>"但你知道如何治療葡萄藤上的葡萄根瘤蚜，當你的主人去世後，你娶了他的女兒並繼承了他的葡萄園。"</p>
<p>"Angelica! Here's a gentleman who knows all about us," said the old man,
and then, grinning from ear to ear, he added:</p><p>“安吉莉卡！這裡有位先生了解我們所有的事情，”老人說，
然後，他咧嘴一笑，補充說：</p>
<p>"Perhaps your Excellency was the young gentleman who used to visit with
his father at the Count's palace on the hill twenty to thirty years
ago?"</p><p>"也許閣下就是那位二三十年前曾隨其父親拜訪過位於山上伯爵宮殿的年輕紳士?"</p>
<p>David Rossi looked him steadfastly in the face and said: "Do you
remember the poor boy who lived with you at that time?"</p><p>大衛·羅西堅定地看著他的臉，說道：“你還記得那個時候和你一起生活的窮孩子嗎？”</p>
<p>The forced smile was gone in a moment. "We had no boy then, Excellency."</p><p>強迫的笑容一瞬間便消失了。"那時候，我們並沒有男孩，閣下。"</p>
<p>"He came to you from Santo Spirito and you got a hundred francs with him
at first, and then you built this pergola."</p><p>他從聖托斯皮里托來找你，起初你和他一起得到了一百法郎，然後你就建造了這個涼亭。</p>
<p>"If your Excellency is from the Foundling, you may tell them again, as I
told the priest who came before, that we never took a boy from there,
and we had no money from the people who sent him to London."</p><p>如果閣下來自育嬰堂，您可以再次告訴他們，正如我之前告訴那位神父一樣，我們從未從那裡帶走過一個男孩，並且我們沒有從將他送往倫敦的人那裡獲得任何金錢。</p>
<p>"You don't remember him, then?"</p><p>那麼，你不記得他嗎？</p>
<p>"Certainly not."</p><p>當然不是。</p>
<p>"Nor you?"</p><p>你呢？</p>
<p>The old woman hesitated, and the old man made mouths at her.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00148" title="113"><a id="Page_113" title="113"></a></span></p><p>老婦人猶豫不決，而老男人則對她做了鬼臉。</p>
<p>"No, Excellency."</p><p>不，閣下。</p>
<p>David Rossi took a long breath. "Here is the amount of your bill, and
something over. Good-bye!"</p><p>大衛·羅西深深地吸了一口氣，"這是您的帳單金額，還有一些多餘的。再見！"</p>
<p>The timid lad brought round the horses and the riders prepared to mount.
Roma was looking at the boy with pitying eyes.</p><p>膽小的男孩帶著馬兒過來，騎士們準備上馬。
羅馬用憐憫的眼神看著那個男孩。</p>
<p>"How long have you been here?" she asked.</p><p>"你在這裡多久了?"她問。</p>
<p>"Ten years, Excellency," he replied.</p><p>“十年了，閣下。”他回答道。</p>
<p>He was just twelve years of age and both his parents were dead.</p><p>他僅有十二歲而他的雙親都已去世。</p>
<p>"Poor little fellow!" said Roma, and before David Rossi could prevent
her she was emptying her purse into the boy's hand.</p><p>"真可憐的小傢伙！" 羅馬說。而在大衛·羅西能夠阻止她之前，她已經把錢包裡的錢全部倒進了男孩的手中。</p>
<p>They set off at a trot, and for some time they did not exchange a word.
The sun was sinking and the golden day was dying down. Over the broad
swell of the Campagna, treeless, houseless, a dull haze was creeping
like a shroud, and the long knotted grass was swept by the chill breath
of evening. Nothing broke the wide silence of the desolate space except
the lowing of cattle, the bleat of sheep that were moving in masses like
the woolly waves of a sea, the bark of big white dogs, the shouts of
cowherds carrying long staves, and of shepherds riding on shaggy ponies.
Here and there were wretched straw huts, with groups of fever-stricken
people crouching over the embers of miserable fires, and here and there
were dirty pothouses, which alternated with wooden crosses of the Christ
and grass-covered shrines of the Madonna.</p><p>他們起身小跑，過了一段時間沒有交換一句話。太陽正在下沉，金色的一天正在消逝。在陡峻的Campagna上，沒有樹木，沒有房屋，一層呆滯的霧氣就像屍衣一樣悄然爬上來，長長的結草被晚霞的寒氣掠過。除了牛的低叫，像海浪一樣移動的羊群的咩咩聲，大白狗的吠聲，手持長杖的牧牛人和騎著毛茸茸小馬的牧羊人的吆喝聲之外，寂靜的荒原沒有任何聲音破壞她的寂靜。在這裡和那裡，有一些病弱的人群團困在一起，蜷縮在可憐火焰的餘燼上，而在這裡和那裡，有一些骯髒的小酒館，與基督的木製十字架和滿是草木的麥當勞聖母神龕交錯。</p>
<p>The rhythm of the saddles ceased and the horses walked.</p><p>鞍具的節奏停止了，馬兒開始行走。</p>
<p>"Was that the place where you were brought up?" said Roma.</p><p>"那是你成長的地方嗎？" 羅馬說。</p>
<p>"Yes."</p><p>是</p>
<p>"And those were the people who sold you into slavery, so to speak?"</p><p>「那些就是把你賣入奴隸的人，可以這麼說嗎？」</p>
<p>"Yes."</p><p>是</p>
<p>"And you could have confounded them with one word, and did not!"</p><p>你本可以用一個詞語使他們困惑，卻沒有！</p>
<p>"What was the use? Besides, they were not the first offenders."</p><p>有什麼用呢？再說，他們又不是第一次犯錯。</p>
<p>"No; your father was more to blame. Don't you feel sometimes as if you
could hate him for what he has made you suffer?"</p><p>不，你的父親更應該受到責備。你有沒有時候覺得你能為他讓你承受的痛苦而恨他？</p>
<p>David Rossi shook his head. "I was saved from that bitterness by the
saint who saved me from so much besides.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00149" title="114"><a id="Page_114" title="114"></a></span> 'Don't try to find out who
your father is, David,' he said, 'and if by chance you ever do find out,
don't return evil for evil, and don't avenge yourself on the world.
By-and-bye the world will know you for what you are yourself, not for
what your father is. Perhaps your father is a bad man, perhaps he isn't.
Leave him to God!'"</p><p>大衛·羅西搖了搖頭。他說：“我被那位拯救了我從許多其他事情中的聖人，從苦澀中拯救出來。'大衛，不要試圖找出你的父親是誰，'他說，'如果你碰巧知道了，不要以惡報惡，不要對世界復仇。最終，世界會因你自身的特質而認識你，不是因為你的父親。或許你的父親是個壞人，也可能他不是。把他交給上帝吧！'”</p>
<p>"It's a terrible thing to think evil of one's own father, isn't it?"
said Roma, but David Rossi did not reply.</p><p>"這是一件很糟糕的事情，對自己的父親抱著惡意的想法，不是嗎?" 羅馬說，但是大衛·羅西並未回答。</p>
<p>"And then—who knows?—perhaps some day you may discover that your
father deserved your love and pity after all."</p><p>然後，誰知道呢？也許有一天，你會發現你的父親其實是值得你的愛與同情的。</p>
<p>"Perhaps!"</p><p>也許！</p>
<p>They had drawn up at another house under a thick clump of eucalyptus
trees. It was the Trappist Monastery of Tre Fontane. Silence was
everywhere in this home of silence.</p><p>他們在一片濃密的桉樹下的另一棟房子停車。那是特雷豐塔內的特拉皮斯特修道院。在這個寂靜之家裡，四處都是寂靜。</p>
<p>They went up on to the roof. From that height the whole world around
seemed to be invaded by silence.</p><p>他們上了屋頂。從那麼高的地方看，周圍的整個世界似乎都被寂靜所侵蝕。</p>
<p>It was the silence of all sacred things, the silence of the mass; and
the undying paganism in the hearts of the two that stood there had its
eloquent silence also.</p><p>那是所有神聖事物的寂靜，是彌撒的寂靜；而在那兩個站在那裡的人的心中不朽的異教信仰，也有其富有含意的寂靜。</p>
<p>Roma was leaning on the parapet with David Rossi behind her, when
suddenly she began to weep. She wept violently and sobbed.</p><p>當羅馬靠著欄杆，大衛·羅西在她後面時，她突然開始哭泣。她痛苦地哭泣和抽泣。</p>
<p>"What is it?" he asked, but she did not answer.</p><p>「這是什麼？」他問，但她並未回答。</p>
<p>After a while she grew calm and dried her eyes, called herself foolish,
and began to laugh. But the heart-beats were too audible without saying
something, and at length she tried to speak.</p><p>過了一會兒，她漸漸冷靜下來，擦乾了眼淚，呼自己愚蠢，並開始笑。但那心跳聲太明顯了，她無法不說點什麼，終於，她試著開口說話。</p>
<p>"It was the poor boy at the inn," she said; "the sight of his sweet face
brought back a scene I had quite forgotten," and then, in a faltering
voice, turning her head away, she told him everything.</p><p>"那是在客棧的那個可憐男孩，"她說，"他那甜美的臉龐讓我想起了一幕我早已遺忘的景象。"然後，她以顫抖的聲音轉過頭去，將所有事情都告訴了他。</p>
<p>"It was in London, and my father had found a little Roman boy in the
streets on a winter's night, carrying a squirrel and playing an
accordion. He wore a tattered suit of velveteens, and that was all that
sheltered his little body from the cold. His fingers were frozen stiff,
and he fainted when they brought him into the house. After a while he
opened his eyes, and gazed around at the fire and the faces about him,
and seemed to be looking for something. It was his squirrel, and it was
frozen dead. But he grasped it tight and big tears rolled on to his
cheeks, and he raised himself as if to escape. He was too weak for that,
and my father comforted him and he lay still. That was when I saw him<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00150" title="115"><a id="Page_115" title="115"></a></span>
first; and looking at the poor boy at the inn I thought ... I thought
perhaps he was another ... perhaps my little friend of long ago...."</p><p>那是在倫敦，我的父親在冬夜的街頭發現了一個小羅馬男孩，他手裡抱著一隻松鼠，邊走邊演奏手風琴。他穿著一套破爛的絲絨服裝，那是他小小的體驗對抗寒冷的唯一防護。他的手指凍僵了，當他們帶他進房子的時候，他昏過去了。過了一會兒，他睜開眼睛，望著他周圍的火和臉孔，看起來像在找什麼。那是他的松鼠，而且已經凍死了。但他緊緊地抓住它，大淚珠滾落在他的臉頰上，他努力地坐起來，好像要逃跑。他已經太虛弱了，無法逃脫，我父親安慰他，他就靜靜地躺下。那是我第一次看到他；看著旅店裡那個可憐的男孩，我在想......我在想他可能是另一個......也許是很久以前的那個小朋友。</p>
<p>Her throat was throbbing, and her faltering voice was failing like a
pendulum that is about to stop.</p><p>她的喉嚨在跳動，她那顫抖的聲音就像快要停止的搖擺鐘。</p>
<p>"Roma!" he cried over her shoulder.</p><p>"羅馬！"他越過她的肩膀喊道。</p>
<p>"David!"</p><p>大衛！</p>
<p>Their eyes met, their hands clasped, their pent-up secret was out, and
in the dim-lit catacombs of love two souls stood face to face.</p><p>他們的目光相遇，他們的手緊握在一起，他們悶在心中的秘密終於曝光。在模糊的愛情地道中，兩個靈魂正面對面站立。</p>
<p>"How long have you known it?" she whispered.</p><p>"你知道這件事多久了？"她低聲問。</p>
<p>"Since the night you came to the Piazza Navona. And you?"</p><p>自從你來到納佛納廣場的那個晚上。你呢？</p>
<p>"Since the moment I heard your voice." And then she shuddered and
laughed.</p><p>自從我聽到你的聲音的那一刻起。”然後，她不禁打了個寒顫，並笑了起來。</p>
<p>When they left the house of silence a blessed hush had fallen on them, a
great wonder which they had never known before, the wonder of the
everlasting miracle of human hearts.</p><p>當他們離開寂靜之屋時，一種神聖的寂靜籠罩了他們，一種他們從未有過的偉大驚奇，那就是人類心靈永恆奇蹟的驚奇。</p>
<p>The sun was sitting behind Rome in a glorious blaze of crimson, with the
domes of churches glistening in the horizontal rays, and the dark globe
of St. Peter's hovering over all. The mortal melancholy which had been
lying over the world seemed to be lifted away, and the earth smiled with
flowers and the heavens shone with gold.</p><p>太陽在羅馬的背後沉落，燦爛的暗紅色光芒四射。教堂的圓頂在橫向的陽光照射下閃閃發光，而聖彼得的黑色地球居高臨下，懸浮在整片景象之上。之前籠罩在世界上的過度憂鬱似乎被揭去，大地露出微笑，盛開著鮮花，而天空閃耀著金光。</p>
<p>Only the rhythmic cadence of the saddles broke the silence as they swung
to the movement of the horses. Sometimes they looked at each other, and
then they smiled, but they did not speak.</p><p>只有馬鞍的節奏性響聲打破了寂靜，隨著馬兒的運動擺動。有時他們會互相凝視，然後微笑，但是並不說話。</p>
<p>The sun went down, and there was a far-off ringing of bells. It was Ava
Maria. They drew up the horses for a moment and dropped their heads.
Then they started again.</p><p>太陽下山了，遠處響起了鐘聲。那是阿維瑪利亞。他們暫時讓馬停了下來，低下了頭。然後，他們又重新出發了。</p>
<p>The night chills were coming, and they rode hard. Roma bent over the
mane of her horse and looked proud and happy.</p><p>夜晚的寒意逼近，他們騎得很猛烈。羅馬俯身看著她的馬鬃，看起來既自豪又快樂。</p>
<p>Grooms were waiting for them at the gate of St. Paul, and, giving up
their horses, they got into a carriage. When they reached Trinità de'
Monti the lamplighter was lighting the lamps on the steps of the piazza,
and Roma said in a low voice, with a blush and a smile:</p><p>新郎們在聖保羅的門口等著他們，他們把馬交給了馬伕，然後上了馬車。當他們到達特立尼塔德蒙蒂時，燈光工人正在廣場的臺階上點燃燈火，羅馬低聲說，帶著臉紅和微笑：</p>
<p>"Don't come in to-night—not to-night, you know."</p><p>今晚別來，你知道的，就是今晚別來。</p>
<p>She wanted to be alone.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00151" title="116"><a id="Page_116" title="116"></a></span></p><p>她想要獨處。</p>
<h3 id="pgepubid00152">XI</h3>
<p>Felice met Roma at the door of her own apartment, and in more than
usually sepulchral tones announced that the Countess had wished to see
her as soon as she came home. Without waiting to change her
riding-habit, Roma turned into her aunt's room.</p><p>菲利斯在她自己的公寓門口遇到了羅馬，並以比平常更為淒涼的語氣宣佈，伯爵夫人希望能在她回家後立即見到她。羅馬沒有等待更換她的騎衣，就轉向了她的阿姨的房間。</p>
<p>The old lady was propped up with pillows, and Natalina was fussing about
her. Her eyes glittered, her thin lips were compressed, and regardless
of the presence of the maid, she straightway fell upon Roma with bitter
reproaches.</p><p>那位老太太被枕頭墊起來，Natalina在她身邊忙來忙去。她的眼睛閃閃發光，她的薄唇緊緊壓住，不顧女僕的在場，她立即對Roma提出了尖酸刻薄的責難。</p>
<p>"Did you wish to see me, aunt?" said Roma, and the old lady answered in
a mocking falsetto:</p><p>"羅馬問，"姨媽，你想見我嗎？" 老夫人用嘲諷的假聲回答：</p>
<p>"Did I wish to see you, miss? Certainly I wished to see you, although
I'm a broken-hearted woman and sorry for the day I saw you first."</p><p>我是否希望見到你，小姐？當然，我希望見到你，儘管我是一個心碎的女人，為我初次見到你的那一天感到遺憾。</p>
<p>"What have I done now?" said Roma, and the radiant look in her face
provoked the old lady to still louder denunciations.</p><p>"我現在做了什麼呢？"羅馬說，她臉上的燦爛神情激起了老太太更大的譴責。</p>
<p>"What have you done? Mercy me!... Give me my salts, Natalina!"</p><p>你做了什麼？天哪！… 給我我的鹽，納塔麗娜！</p>
<p>"Natalina," said Roma quietly, "lay out my studio things, and if Bruno
has gone, tell Felice to light the lamps and see to the stove
downstairs."</p><p>"納塔麗娜，" 羅馬平靜地說，" 把我的工作室東西擺好，如果布魯諾走了，告訴費利斯點亮燈並檢查樓下的爐子。"</p>
<p>The old lady fanned herself with her embroidered handkerchief and began
again.</p><p>那位老太太用她的刺繡手帕給自己搧風，然後又重新開始了。</p>
<p>"I thought you meant to mend your ways when you came in yesterday,
miss—you were so meek and modest. But what was the fact? You had come
to me straight from that man's apartments. You had! You know you had!
Don't try to deny it."</p><p>我本以為你昨天來的時候打算改過自新，小姐——你表現得如此溫順謙遜。但事實是什麼呢？你是直接從那個男人的公寓來找我的。是的！你知道自己有這麼做！不試圖否認這點。</p>
<p>"I don't deny it," said Roma.</p><p>"我不否認，"羅馬說。</p>
<p>"Holy Virgin! She doesn't deny it! Perhaps you admit it?"</p><p>聖母瑪利亞！她並未否認！或許你承認？</p>
<p>"I do admit it."</p><p>我承認。</p>
<p>"Madonna mia! She admits it! Perhaps you made an appointment?"</p><p>我的天啊！她承認了！你是不是約了她？</p>
<p>"No, I went without an appointment."</p><p>不，我沒有預約就去了。</p>
<p>"Merciful heavens! She is on such terms with the man that she can go to
his apartments without even an appointment! Perhaps you were alone with
him, miss?"</p><p>慈悲的天啊！她與那個男人關係如此密切，甚至不需要約會就可以去他的公寓！也許你是獨自與他在一起的，小姐？</p>
<p>"Yes, we were quite alone," said Roma.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00153" title="117"><a id="Page_117" title="117"></a></span></p><p>"是的，我們當時完全獨自一人，" 羅馬說。</p>
<p>The old lady, who was apparently about to faint right away, looked up at
her little shrine, and said:</p><p>那位看似即將昏倒的老婦人抬頭看向她的小神壇，然後說道:</p>
<p>"Goodness! A girl! Not even a married woman! And without a maid, too!"</p><p>天哪！一個女孩！甚至還沒有結婚！而且還沒有女僕呢！</p>
<p>Trying not to lose control of herself, Roma stepped to the door, but her
aunt followed her up.</p><p>努力不至於失控，羅馬走向門口，但她的阿姨跟隨她一起走上前。</p>
<p>"A man like that, too! Not even a gentleman! The hypocrite! The
impostor! With his airs of purity and pretence!"</p><p>像那樣的男人，也太不是君子了！偽君子！冒牌貨！裝出一副純潔的偽象！</p>
<p>"Aunt Betsy," said Roma, "I was sorry I spoke to you as I did the other
night, not because anything I said was wrong, but because you are weak
and bedridden and suffering. Don't provoke me to speak again as I spoke
before. I did go to Mr. Rossi's rooms yesterday, and if there is any
fault in that, I alone am to blame."</p><p>"貝特西阿姨，" 羅馬說，"我對你前幾天的說話感到抱歉，不是因為我說錯，而是因為你身體虛弱，病臥在床，並且在痛苦中。請不要逼我再像以前那樣對你說話。我確實昨天去了羅西先生的房間，如果這有任何錯誤，那我個人應該獨自承擔。"</p>
<p>"Are you indeed?" said the old lady, with a shrill, piping cry. "Holy
Saints! she admits so much! Do you know what people will call you when
they hear of it? A hussy! A shameless hussy!"</p><p>"你真的是這樣嗎？"老太太用尖利的、尖叫的聲音說，"哎呀，聖人吶！她竟然承認了！你知道人們聽到後會怎麼稱呼你嗎？一個輕浮的女人！一個無恥的輕浮女人！"</p>
<p>Roma was flaming up, but she controlled herself and put her hand on the
door-handle.</p><p>羅馬的怒火熊熊燃燒，但她控制住了自己，並把手放在門把手上。</p>
<p>"They <i>will</i> hear of it, depend on that," cried the Countess. "Last
night at dinner the women were talking of nothing else. Felice heard all
their chattering. That woman let the dog out to follow you, knowing it
would go straight to the man's rooms. 'Whom did it come home with,
Felice?' 'Donna Roma, your Excellency.' 'Then it's clear where Donna
Roma had been.' Ugh! I could choke to think of it. My head is fit to
split! Is there any cognac...?"</p><p>"放心，他們一定會聽說的。" 女伯爵大喊道。 "昨晚的晚餐上，女人們只談論這件事。Felice聽到了她們所有的閒聊。那個女人放狗出去跟著你，知道它會直接去那個男人的房間。'它和誰一起回來的，Felice?' '是Donna Roma，閣下。' '那就很清楚Donna Roma去過哪裡了。' 唉！一想到它，我就想噎住。我的頭快炸了！有沒有白蘭地..."</p>
<p>Roma's bosom was visibly stirred by her breathing, but she answered
quietly:</p><p>羅馬的胸部因為她的呼吸而明顯地起伏，但她靜靜地回答：</p>
<p>"No matter! Why should I care what is thought of my conduct by people
who have no morality of their own to judge me by?"</p><p>沒關係！為什麼我要在乎那些自身沒有道德可以評價我的人對我行為的想法呢？</p>
<p>"Really now?" said the Countess, twisting the wrinkles of her old face
into skeins of mock courtesy. "Upon my word, I didn't think you were so
simple. Understand, miss, it isn't the opinion of the Princess Bellini I
am thinking about, but that of the Baron Bonelli. He has his dignity to
consider, and when the time comes and he is free to take a wife, he is
not likely to marry a girl who has been talked of with another man.
Don't you see what that woman is doing? She has been doing it all along,
and like a simpleton<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00154" title="118"><a id="Page_118" title="118"></a></span> you've been helping her. You've been flinging away
your chances with this Rossi and making yourself impossible to the
Minister."</p><p>"真的嗎？"女伯爵嘲諷地扭曲了她老化的面孔的皺紋。"我的天哪，我沒想到你這麼單純。你要明白，小姐，我在想的並不是貝利尼公主的觀點，而是邦內利男爵的觀點。他必須考慮他的尊嚴，當時機來臨，他可以娶妻時，他不太可能娶一個被別的男人訴說過的女孩。你看不到那個女人在做什麼嗎？她一直在做，像一個傻瓜一樣你一直在幫助她。你一直在拋棄與這個羅西的機會，並使自己無法成為部長的人選。"</p>
<p>Roma tossed her head and answered:</p><p>羅馬擺了擺頭，回答說：</p>
<p>"I don't care if I have, Aunt Betsy. I'm not of the same mind as I used
to be, and I think no longer that the holiest things are to be bought
and sold like so much merchandise."</p><p>「我不在乎我是否有，貝西姨媽。我現在的想法已經不同於過去了，我不再認為最神聖的事物就像商品一樣可以買賣。」</p>
<p>The old lady, who had been bending forward in her vehemence, fell back
on the pillow.</p><p>這位傾身前彎的老太太在她的激動中跌回枕頭上。</p>
<p>"You'll kill me!" she cried. "Where did you learn such folly? Goodness
knows I've done my best by you. I have tried to teach you your duty to
the baron and to society. But all this comes of admitting these
anarchists into the house. You can't help it, though. It's in your
blood. Your father before you...."</p><p>"你會害死我！"她哭叫著。"你在哪裡學來的這種愚蠢呢？天知道我已經盡力對你好了。我試圖教你對男爵和社會的責任。但這一切都是因為讓這些無政府主義者進入了這個家。然而，你無法避免它。這是你血液中的東西。你的父親以前也是...."</p>
<p>Crimson and trembling from head to foot, Roma turned suddenly and left
the room. Natalina and Felice were listening on the other side of the
door.</p><p>羅馬全身發抖，臉色緋紅，突然轉身離開了房間。娜塔蓮和菲利斯在門的另一邊傾聽。</p>
<p>But not even this jarring incident could break the spell of Roma's
enchantment, and when dinner was over, and she had gone to the studio
and closed the door, the whole world seemed to be shut out, and nothing
was of the slightest consequence.</p><p>但即使這樁令人震驚的事件也無法打破羅馬的魔咒，當晚餐結束，她走進工作室並關上門後，整個世界似乎都被關在了門外，一切都不再有絲毫的重要性。</p>
<p>Taking the damp cloth from the bust, she looked at her work again. In
the light of the aurora she now lived in, the head she had wrought with
so much labour was poor and inadequate. It did not represent the
original. It was weak and wrong.</p><p>她從雕像上拿下濕布，再次審視自己的作品。然而在她現在生活的極光照耀下，她付出巨大努力創作的頭部做得很差且不夠完美。它無法真實地呈現出原作，顯得脆弱且有誤。</p>
<p>She set to work again, and little by little the face in the clay began
to change. Not Peter any longer, Peter the disciple, but Another. It was
audacious, it was shocking, but no matter. She was not afraid.</p><p>她再次開始工作，黏土中的面孔逐漸改變。不再是信徒彼得，而是另一位。這是大膽的，是令人震驚的，但無所謂。她並不害怕。</p>
<p>Time passed, but she did not heed it. She was working at lightning
speed, and with a power she had never felt before.</p><p>時間過去了，但她並未理會。她以從未有過的力量，以像閃電般的速度工作。</p>
<p>Night came on, and the old Rome, the Rome of the Popes, repossessed
itself of the Eternal City. The silent streets, the dark patches, the
luminous piazzas, the three lights on the loggia of the Vatican, the
grey ghost of the great dome, the kind stars, the sweet moon, and the
church bells striking one by one during the noiseless night.</p><p>夜晚來臨，教皇的古老羅馬，重新佔據了永恆之城。寂靜的街道，黑暗的角落，明亮的廣場，梵蒂岡的走廊上的三盞燈光，偉大圓頂的灰色幽靈，友善的星星，甜蜜的月亮，以及在無聲的夜晚，一個又一個教堂鐘聲響起。</p>
<p>At length she became aware of a streak of light on the<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00155" title="119"><a id="Page_119" title="119"></a></span> floor. It was
coming through the shutters of the window. She threw them open, and the
breeze of morning came up from the orange trees in the garden below. The
day was dawning over the sleepy city. Convent bells were ringing for
matins, but all else was still, and the silence was sweet and deep.</p><p>她終於察覺到地板上有一道光線。這是透過窗戶的百葉窗照射進來的。她將百葉窗打開，早晨的微風從下面的花園裡的橙樹上吹來。黎明正在照亮沉睡的城市。修道院的鐘聲正在為清晨的禮拜響起，但其它一切都還靜悄悄的，這份寂靜感覺甜美而深沉。</p>
<p>She turned back to her work and looked at it again. It thrilled her now.
She walked to and fro in the studio and felt as if she were walking on
the stars. She was happy, happy, happy!</p><p>她回過頭繼續她的工作，再次欣賞它。現在，它讓她感到興奮不已。
她在工作室裡走來走去，感覺就像在星星上漫步。她很快樂，非常非常的快樂！</p>
<p>Then the city began to sound on every side. Cabs rattled, electric trams
tinkled, vendors called their wares in the streets, and the new Rome,
the Rome of the Kings, awoke.</p><p>然後，城市從四面八方開始響起。出租車嘈雜地行駛，電車鈴聲響起，街頭小販叫賣他們的商品，新羅馬，國王的羅馬 ont 醒來。</p>
<p>Somebody was singing as he came upstairs. It was Bruno, coming to his
work. He looked astonished, for the lamps were still burning, although
the sunlight was streaming into the room.</p><p>有人在上樓時唱歌，那是布魯諾，他正要去工作。他看起來很驚訝，因為雖然陽光已經灑進房間，燈卻還在燒。</p>
<p>"Been working all night, Donna Roma?"</p><p>你整晚都在工作，唐娜羅馬嗎？</p>
<p>"Fear I have, Bruno, but I'm going to bed now."</p><p>我害怕，布魯諾，但我現在要去睡覺了。</p>
<p>She had an impulse to call him up to her work and say, "Look! I did
that, for I am a great artist." But no! Not yet! Not yet!</p><p>她衝動地想將他叫到她的工作地方，說：“看！這是我做的，因為我是一位偉大的藝術家。”但是不！還不是時候！還不是時候！</p>
<p>She had covered up the clay, and turned the key of her own compartment,
when the bell rang on the floor above. It was the porter with the post,
and Natalina, in curl papers, met her on the landing with the letters.</p><p>她覆蓋了泥土，鎖上自己的隔間，這時樓上的鈴聲響起。那是搬運工帶來的郵件，而卷著頭髮的納塔麗娜在走道上與她相遇，手中拿著信件。</p>
<p>One of them was from the Mayor, thanking her for what she had done for
Charles Minghelli; another was from her landlord, thanking her for his
translation to Paris; a third was from the fashionable modiste, thanking
her for an invitation from the Minister. A feeling of shame came over
her as she glanced at these letters. They brought the implication of an
immoral influence, the atmosphere of an evil life.</p><p>其中一封是來自市長的，感謝她為查爾斯·明赫利所做的一切；另一封是來自她的房東，感謝她將他引進巴黎；第三封是來自時尚的裁剪師，感謝她獲得了來自部長的邀請。當她看到這些信時，羞愧之情湧上心頭。他們帶來的是對不道德影響的暗示，一種邪惡生活的氛圍。</p>
<p>There was a fourth letter. It was from the Minister himself. She had
seen it from the first, but a creepy sense of impending trouble had made
her keep it to the last. Ought she to open it? She ought, she must!</p><p>有第四封信。這是來自部長本人的。她一開始就看到了它，但一種令人毛骨悚然的降臨麻煩的感覺使她將它留到最後。她應該打開它嗎？她應該，她必須！</p>
<p style="padding-top:.5em;">"<span class="smcap">My darling Child</span>,—News at last, too, and success within hail!
Minghelli, the Grand Hotel, the reference in London, and the
dead-and-buried nightmare have led up to and compassed everything!
Prepare for a great surprise—David Rossi<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="120"><a id="Page_120" title="120"></a></span> is <i>not</i> David Rossi, but a

greater surprise—<i>he has no right to live at all</i>!</p><p style="padding-top:.5em;">我親愛的孩子，終於有訊息了，成功就在眼前！明格里、大酒店、倫敦的引用，以及久已過去的噩夢都指向了一切的答案！準備好接受一個大驚喜——大衛·羅西並非大衛·羅西，他是一個在義大利無權生存的罪犯！準備好接受一個更大的驚喜——他根本無權生存！</p>
<p style="padding-bottom:.5em;">"So you are avenged! The man humiliated and degraded you. He insulted me
also, and did his best to make me resign my portfolio and put my private
life on its defence. You set out to undo the effects of his libel and to
punish him for his outrage. You've done it! You have avenged yourself
for both of us! It's all your work! You are magnificent! And now let us
draw the net closer ... let us hold him fast ... let us go on as we have

<p>Her sight grew dim. The letter seemed to be full of blotches. It dropped
out of her helpless fingers. She sat a long time looking out on the
sunlit city, and all the world grew dark and chill. Then she rose, and
her face was pale and rigid.</p><p>她的視力開始模糊，信似乎全是污點。這封信從她無力的手指間滑落。她長時間坐著凝視著陽光照亮的城市，而整個世界變得黑暗並帶著冷意。然後她站起來，她的臉色蒼白而僵硬。</p>
<p>"No, I will <i>not</i> go on!" she thought. "I will <i>not</i> betray him! I will
<i>save</i> him! He insulted me, he humiliated me, he was my enemy, but ... I
love him! I love him!"</p><p>"不，我不會繼續下去！" 她想。"我不會背叛他！我會拯救他！他侮辱了我，他羞辱了我，他是我的敵人，但是...我愛他！我愛他!"</p>

</div>
<h3 id="pgepubid00158">I</h3>
<p>David Rossi was in his bedroom writing his leader for next morning's
paper. A lamp with a dark shade burned on the desk, and the rest of the
room was in shadow. It was late, and the house was quiet.</p><p>大衛·羅西在他的臥室裡為第二天早晨的報紙撰寫他的領導文章。書桌上燃燒著一盞黑色燈罩的燈，房間的其餘部分都在陰影中。已經很晚了，房子裡一片寧靜。</p>
<p>The door opened softly, and Bruno, in shirt-sleeves and slippered feet,
came on tiptoe into the room. He brought a letter in a large violet
envelope with a monogram on the front of it, and put it down on the desk
by Rossi's side. It was from Roma.</p><p>門輕輕打開，布魯諾只穿著襯衫，腳上穿著拖鞋，躡手躡腳地走進了房間。他帶來了一封裝在大紫色信封中的信，信封前面有一個字母組合，並將它放在羅西旁邊的桌子上。這是來自羅馬的一封信。</p>
<p style="padding-top:.5em;"><span class="smcap">"Dear David Rossi</span>,—Without rhyme or reason I have been expecting to see
you here to-day, having something to say which it is important that you
should hear. May I expect you in the morning? Knowing how busy you are,
I dare not bid you come, yet the matter is of great consequence and
admits of no delay. It is not a subject on which it is safe or proper to
write, and how to speak of it I am at a loss to decide. But you shall
help me. Therefore come without delay! There! I have bidden you come in
spite of myself. Judge from that how eager is my expectation.—In haste,</p><p style="padding-top:.5em;">親愛的大衛·羅西，—無謀之謀出乎意料地期待你今天來看我，因有話要告訴你，這很重要你應該聽到。我可以期待你明早來嗎？知道你有多忙，我不敢催你來，但事情確實非常重要，不能延遲。這不是一個可以安全或適當地書寫的主題，我該如何談論它，我也無法決定。但你應該幫助我。所以請不要延遲來！現在！儘管如此，我還是要你來。從那裡判斷我的期待有多麼迫切。—匆忙間，</p>
<p style="text-align:right; margin-top:-1em;">"<span class="smcap">Roma V</span>.</p><p style="text-align:right; margin-top:-1em;">羅馬五</p>
<p style="padding-bottom:.5em;">"P.S.—I open my envelope, to wonder if you can ever forgive me the
humiliations you have suffered for my sake. To think that <i>I</i> threw you
into the way of them! And merely to wipe out an offence that is not
worth considering! I am ashamed of myself. I am also ashamed of the
people about me. You will remember that I told you they were pitiless
and cruel. They are worse—they are heartless and without mercy. But how
bravely you bore their insults and innuendoes! I almost cry to think of
it, and if I were a good Catholic I should confess and do penance. See?
I do confess, and if you want me to do penance you will come yourself
and impose it."</p><p style="padding-bottom:.5em;">附言 - 我打開我的信封，想知道你是否能夠原諒我，讓你因我而遭受的羞辱。想到是我把你推到這種境地真是令人悲哀！而且只是為了消除一個不值一提的冒犯！我為自己感到羞愧，我也為我身邊的人感到羞愧。你會記得我告訴你他們是無情的，也是殘酷的。他們比這更遭，沒有憐憫之心。但你是多麼勇敢地忍受他們的侮辱和譏諷！想到這就快要哭出來了，如果我是個虔誠的天主教徒，我會去告解並做衣食。看？我確實在告解，如果你想我做補贖，你將親自來要求我這麼做。</p>
<p><span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00159" title="122"><a id="Page_122" title="122"></a></span>
It was the first letter that David Rossi had received from Roma, and as
he read it the air seemed to him to be filled with the sweet girlish
voice. He could see the play of her large, bright, violet eyes. The
delicate fragrance of the scented paper rose to his nostrils, and
without being conscious of what he was doing he raised the letter to his
lips.</p><p>這是大衛·羅西從羅馬收到的第一封信，當他讀著它時，空氣似乎充滿了甜美的女聲。他能看到她那雙大大的，明亮的，紫羅蘭色的眼睛的閃爍。香紙的淡淡香氣飄到他的鼻子，不知不覺中，他把信舉到了嘴唇。</p>
<p>Then he became aware that Bruno was still in the room. The good fellow
was in the shadow behind him, pushing things about under some pretext
and trying to make a noise.</p><p>然後，他意識到布魯諾還在房間裡。這位好人在他身後的陰影中，以某種藉口四處推動物品，試圖製造噪音。</p>
<p>"Don't let me keep you up, Bruno."</p><p>不要讓我阻止你休息，布魯諾。</p>
<p>"Sure you don't want anything, sir?" said Bruno with confusion.</p><p>"您確定不需要任何東西嗎，先生？"布魯諾困惑地說。</p>
<p>David Rossi rose and walked about the room with his slow step.</p><p>大衛·羅西起身並以他緩慢的步伐在房間裡走動。</p>
<p>"You have something to say to me?"</p><p>你有什麼要對我說的嗎？</p>
<p>"Well, yes, sir—yes, I have."</p><p>好的，是的，先生—我有。</p>
<p>"What is it?"</p><p>這是什麼？</p>
<p>Bruno scratched his shock head and looked about as if for help. His eyes
fell on the letter lying open in the light on the desk.</p><p>布魯諾抓著他驚訝的頭，四顧如尋求幫助。他的目光落在桌上燈光下敞開的信上。</p>
<p>"It's about that, sir. I knew where it came from by the colour and the
monogram."</p><p>就是那樣的，先生。我從顏色和字母圖案就知道它來自哪裡。</p>
<p>"Well?"</p><p>好嗎？</p>
<p>Bruno began to look frightened, and then in a louder voice, that bubbled
out of his mouth like water from the neck of a bottle, he said:</p><p>布魯諾開始顯得害怕，然後他的聲音變大，就像水從瓶頸泡出一樣，他說：</p>
<p>"Tell you the truth, sir, people are talking about you."</p><p>老實告訴你，先生，人們都在談論你。</p>
<p>"What are they saying, Bruno?"</p><p>他們在說什麼，布魯諾？</p>
<p>"Saying?... Ever heard the proverb, 'Sun in the eyes, the battle lost'?
Sun in the eyes—that's what they're saying, sir."</p><p>"說嗎？...你聽過這句諺語，'陽光照眼，戰役已失'嗎？
陽光照眼 - 他們正在說這個，先生。"</p>
<p>"So they're saying that, are they?"</p><p>所以他們是這麼說的嗎？</p>
<p>"They are. And doesn't it look like it, sir? You'll allow it looks like
it, anyway. When you started the Republic, sir, the people had hopes of
you. But a month is gone and you haven't done a thing."</p><p>他們是的。這看起來不像是這樣嗎，先生？你至少會承認它看起來像是這樣。當你開始建立共和國時，人們對你抱有希望。但是一個月過去了，你卻什麼都沒做。</p>
<p>David Rossi, with head down, continued to pace to and fro.</p><p>大衛·羅西低著頭，繼續來回踱步。</p>
<p>"'Patience,' I'm saying. 'Go slow and sure,' says I. That's all right,
sir, but the Government is going fast enough. Forty thousand men called
out to keep the people quiet, and when the bread-tax begins on the first
of the month the blessed saints know what will happen. Next week<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00160" title="123"><a id="Page_123" title="123"></a></span> we
hold our meeting in the Coliseum. You called it yourself, sir, yet
they're laying odds you won't be there. Where will you be? In the house
of a bad woman?"</p><p>"「耐心，」我說，「要慢而穩，」我說。那沒錯，先生，但是政府正在快速行動。四萬名男子被召集來使人民保持安靜，而當月初的麵包稅開始時，神聖的聖人知道會發生什麼事。下週我們將在大競技場裡進行會議。你自己稱之為先生，但他們賭你不會在那裡。你會在哪裡？在壞女人的房子裡嗎？"</p>
<p>"Bruno!" cried Rossi in a stern voice, "what right have you to talk to
me like this?"</p><p>"布魯諾!" 羅西嚴厲地喊道，"你有什麼權利這樣對我說話?"</p>
<p>Bruno was frightened at what he had said, but he tried to carry it off
with a look of passion.</p><p>布魯諾對他所說的話感到害怕，但他試圖用充滿激情的眼神掩飾過去。</p>
<p>"Right? The right of a friend, sir, who can't stand by and see you
betrayed. Yes, betrayed, that's the word for it. Betrayed! Betrayed!
It's a plot to ruin the people through the weakness of their leader. A
woman drawn across a man's trail. The trick is as old as the ages. Never
heard what we say in Rome?—'The man is fire, the woman is tow; then
comes the devil and puts them together.'"</p><p>對吧？這是一位朋友的權利，先生，他無法靜看您被背叛。是的，背叛，這是最適合的詞。背叛！背叛！這是一個透過領導者的弱點來毀滅人民的陰謀。一個女人橫跨了男人的道路。這種手法古老如常。從未聽說我們在羅馬說的話嗎？- '男人是火，女人是火種；接著魔鬼將他們組合在一起。'</p>
<p>David Rossi was standing face to face with Bruno, who was growing hot
and trying to laugh bitterly.</p><p>大衛·羅西正與布魯諾面對面站著，布魯諾正在變得激動並試圖苦笑。</p>
<p>"Oh, I know what I'm saying, sir. The Prime Minister is at the bottom of
everything. David Rossi never goes to Donna Roma's house but the Baron
Bonelli knows all about it. They write to each other every day, and I've

<p style="padding-top:.5em;">"<span class="smcap">My dear</span> R.,—You have nothing to reproach yourself with in regard to my
poor doings, or tryings-to-do. They were necessary, and if the penalties
had been worse a hundredfold I should not chew the cud of my bargain
now. Besides your wish, I had another motive, a secret motive, and
perhaps, if I were a good Catholic, I should confess too, although not
with a view to penance. Apparently, it has come out well, and now that
it seems to be all over, both your scheme and mine, now that the wrong I
did you is to some extent undone, and my own object is in some measure
achieved, I find myself face to face with a position in which it is my
duty to you as well as to myself to bring our intercourse to an end.</p><p style="padding-top:.5em;">親愛的R.，對於我那可憐的行動或嘗試行動，你無需自責。這些都是必要的，即使代價再大一百倍，我現在也不會後悔。除了你的期望，我還有另一個動機，一個秘密的動機，也許，如果我是一個虔誠的天主教徒，我應該也要去告解，雖然並非為了尋求贖罪。顯然，結果似乎不壞，現在看來一切都結束了，你的計劃和我的計劃，我對你的錯誤在一定程度上已經得到了彌補，我的目標也在一定程度上已經實現，我發現自己面對一種情況，我有義務結束我們的交往，這對你與我都是一種責任。</p>
<p>"The truth is that we cannot be friends any longer, for the reason that
I love some one in whom you are, unhappily, too much interested, and
because there are obstacles between that person and myself which are
decisive and insurmountable. This<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00164" title="126"><a id="Page_126" title="126"></a></span> alone puts it on me as a point of
honour that you and I should never see each other again. Each of my
visits adds to my embarrassment, to the feeling that I am doing wrong in
paying them, and to the certainty that I must give them up altogether.</p><p>事實上，我們已無法再做朋友，原因是我愛上了一個無奈地讓你過度投入的人，並且我和那個人之間有著決定性且無法克服的障礙。單單這一點，就使我有責任必須堅持你和我不再見面。每一次見面都增加了我的困擾，使我覺得我在做錯事，並讓我確定我必須完全停止見面。</p>
<p>"Thank you again and again for the more than pleasant hours we have
spent together. It is not your fault that I must bury the memory of them
in oblivion. This does not mean that it is any part of the painful but
unavoidable result of circumstances I cannot explain, that we should not
write to each other as occasion may arise. Continue to think of me as
your brother—your brother far away—to be called upon for counsel in
your hour of need and necessity. And whenever you call, be sure I shall
be there.</p><p>再次感謝您和我共度的美好時光。我必須將這些記憶埋藏在遺忘之中，但這絕不是您的過錯。這並不意味著我們應該停止書信往來，只是因為無法解釋的狀況而產生的痛苦但無法避免的結果。請繼續將我視為你遠在他方的兄弟，當你需要幫助和建議的時候可以找我。每當你召喚，我定會在那裡。</p>
<p>"What you say of an important matter suggests that something has come to
your knowledge which concerns myself and the authorities; but when a man
has spent all his life on the edge of a precipice, the most urgent
perils are of little moment, and I beg of you not to be alarmed for my
sake. Whatever it is, it is only a part of the atmosphere of danger I
have always lived in—the glacier I have always walked upon—and 'if it
is not now, it is to come; if it is not to come, it will be now—the
readiness is all.' Good-bye!—Yours, dear R——,</p><p>你對於重要事項的言論表明，你已得知某些與我和當局有關的事情。但當一個人一生都在懸崖邊緣度過，最急迫的危險也變得微不足道，我請求你不需要為我擔憂。無論是什麼，它只是我一直生活中危險氛圍的一部分 - 我總是走在冰川上 - 如果不是現在，那就是將來，如果不是將來，那就是現在 - 一切準備就緒。再見！親愛的R—。</p>

<p style="padding-top:.5em;">"<span class="smcap">My dear</span> D.,—Your letter has thrown me into the wildest state of
excitement and confusion. I have done no work all day long, and when
Black has leapt upon me and cried, 'Come out for a walk, you dear, dear
dunce,' I have hardly known whether he barked or talked.</p><p style="padding-top:.5em;">我親愛的D，你的信讓我陷入了極度的興奮和混亂中。我一整天都沒有做任何工作，而當布萊克跳到我身上並呼喚說，'出來散步吧，你這可愛的大笨蛋'，我幾乎不確定他是吠叫還是在說話。</p>
<p>"I am sorry our charming intercourse is to be interrupted, but you can't
mean that it is to be broken off altogether. You can't, you can't, or my
eyes would be red with crying, instead of dancing with delight.</p><p>對不起，我們迷人的交往要被打斷，但你不能意味著要完全斷絕。你不能，你不能，否則我的眼睛會因為哭泣而變得紅腫，而不是因為開心而閃爍。</p>
<p>"Yet why they should dance I don't really know, seeing you are so
indefinite, and I have no right to understand anything. If you cannot
write by post, or even send messages by hand, if my man F. is your
enemy, and your housemate B. is mine, isn't that precisely the best
reason why you should<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00166" title="127"><a id="Page_127" title="127"></a></span> come and talk matters over? Come at once. I bid
you come! In a matter of such inconceivable importance, surely a sister
has a right to command.</p><p>然而為何他們應該跳舞，我真的不知道，看見你如此模糊不清，我無權理解任何事情。如果你不能透過郵寄或是親手傳遞資訊，如果我的男人F.是你的敵人，而你的室友B.是我的敵人，這難道不正是你應該過來商量事情的最佳理由嗎？立即過來。我要求你來！在如此難以置信的重要事件中，一個姐姐肯定有權命令。</p>
<p>"In that character, I suppose, I ought to be glad of the news you give
me. Well, I <i>am</i> glad! But being a daughter of Eve, I have a right to be
curious. I want to ask questions. You say I know the lady, and am,
unhappily, too deeply interested in her—who is she? Does she know of
your love for her? Is she beautiful? Is she charming? Give me one
initial of her name—only one—and I will be good. I am so much in the
dark, and I cannot commit myself until I know more.</p><p>在那個性格中，我想，我應該對你給我的消息感到高興。好吧，我很高興！但作為夏娃的女兒，我有權好奇。我想要提問。你說我認識那位女士，並且，不幸的是，我過於深入地關注她——她是誰？她知道你對她的愛嗎？她美麗嗎？她迷人嗎？給我她名字的一個首字母——只需要一個——我會乖乖的。我太陷在黑暗中了，我無法承諾我自己，直到我知道更多。</p>
<p>"You speak of obstacles, and say they are decisive and insurmountable.
That's terrible, but perhaps you are only thinking of what the poets
call the 'cruel madness' of love, as if its madness and cruelty were
sufficient reason for flying away from it. Or perhaps the obstacles are
those of circumstances; but in that case, if the woman is the right one,
she will be willing to wait for such difficulties to be got over, or
even to find her happiness in sharing them.</p><p>"你論及障礙，認為它們極其決定性且難以克服。這樣的觀點十分可怕，但也許你只是在想到詩人口中所說的'愛情的殘酷瘋狂'，彷彿其瘋狂與殘酷就是避開它的足夠理由。或許障礙只是外在環境的因素；但在這種情況下，如果這個女人是對的人，她將願意等待這些困難被克服，甚至在共享這些困難中找到她的快樂。"</p>
<p>"See how I plead for my unknown sister! Which is sweet of me,
considering that you don't tell me who she is, but leave me to find out
if she is likely to suit me. But why not let me help you? Come at once
and talk things over.</p><p>"看看我如何為我未知的姐妹辯護！考慮到你並沒有告訴我她是誰，但卻讓我去發現她是否可能與我相稱，這樣做很甜蜜。但為何不讓我幫你呢？立即來並一起討論一下。"</p>
<p>"Yet how vain I am! Even while I proffer assistance with so loud a
voice, I am smitten cold with the fear of an impediment which you know a
thousand times better than I do how to measure and to meet. Perhaps the
woman you speak of is unworthy of your friendship and love. I can
understand that to be an insurmountable obstacle. You stand so high, and
have to think about your work, your aims, your people. And perhaps it is
only a dream and a delusion, a mirage of the heart, that love lifts a
woman up to the level of the man who loves her.</p><p>"然而我多麼虛偽！即使我大聲地提出幫助，我也因為你比我更知道如何測量和麵對的障礙而感到寒冷的恐懼。也許你談到的那個女人不配得到你的友情和愛情。我可以理解這是一個無法克服的障礙。你的地位如此高，還要考慮你的工作，你的目標，你的人民。也許這只是一個夢，一個幻覺，是心中的海市蜃樓，誤以為愛情可以將一個女人提升到愛她的男人的層次。"</p>
<p>"Then there may be some fault—some grave fault. I can understand that
too. We do not love because we should, but because we must, and there is
nothing so cruel as the inequality of man and woman in the way the world
regards their conduct. But I am like a bat in the dark, flying at gleams
of light from closely-curtained windows. Will you not confide in me? Do!
Do! Do!</p><p>"那可能有一些過錯——一些嚴重的過錯。我也能理解那個。我們愛並不是因為我們應該，而是因為我們必須，而世界對男人和女人行為的看法中，沒有什麼比不平等更殘酷的了。但是我就像一隻在黑暗中飛翔的蝙蝠，朝著緊閉窗簾的窗戶裡的光線飛去。你不會向我傾訴嗎? 請！請！請！"</p>

inquiries about you, and appears to have found out various particulars.
Any day may bring urgent news of him, and if you will not come to me I
may have to go to you in spite of every protest.</p><p>"此外，我還有另一件事要討論。你還記得你告訴我你是如何驅逐那個叫M的男人的嗎？結果，他變成了一個間諜並被送到了英國。你應該知道他一直在尋找關於你的消息，而且似乎找出了各種細節。任何一天都可能帶來他的緊急訊息，如果你不來找我，我可能不得不不顧一切反對來找你。"</p>

<p style="padding-top:.5em;">"<span class="smcap">Dear R.</span>,—If anything could add to the bitterness of my regret at
ending an intercourse which has brought me the happiest moments of my
life, it would be the tone of your sweet and charming letter. You ask me
if the woman I love is beautiful. She is more than beautiful, she is
lovely. You ask me if she knows that I love her. I have never dared to
disclose my secret, and if I could have believed that she had ever so
much as guessed at it, I should have found some consolation in a feeling
which is too deep for the humiliations of pride. You ask me if she is
worthy of my friendship and love. She is worthy of the love and
friendship of a better man than I am or can ever hope to be.</p><p style="padding-top:.5em;">"親愛的 R.，—如果有什麼可以增加我對結束這種有過我生命中最快樂時刻的交往的痛苦，那就是你甜美而迷人的信中的語氣。你問我愛的女人是否美麗。她不僅美麗，她更是可愛。你問我她是否知道我愛她。我從未敢透露我的秘密，如果我能相信她曾經猜到我有這種感覺，我應該在一種深深的感覺中找到一些安慰，這種感覺對於驕傲的羞辱來說太深了。你問我她是否值得我的友誼和愛情。她值得比我更好的男人的愛情和友誼，我是或希望能成為的那種男人。"</p>
<p>"Yet even if she were not so, even if there were, as you say, a fault in
her, who am I that I should judge her harshly? I am not one of those who
think that a woman is fallen because circumstances and evil men have
conspired against her. I reject the monstrous theory that while a man
may redeem the past, a woman never can. I abhor the judgment of the
world by which a woman may be punished because she is trying to be pure,
and dragged down because she is rising from the dirt. And if she had
sinned as I have sinned, and suffered as I have suffered, I would pray
for strength enough to say, 'Because I love her we are one, and we stand
or fall together.'</p><p>"即使她不完美，即使像你說的，她有缺點，我又有什麼資格苛刻地評價她呢？我不屬於那些認為女人墮落是因為環境和惡劣的男人共謀對她不利的人。我拒絕這種野蠻的理論，即男人可以贖回過去，而女人永遠不能。我憎恨世界的判斷，因為她試圖變得純潔而被懲罰，因為她試圖從污穢中振作而被拖垮。如果她像我一樣犯了罪，像我一樣遭受痛苦，我會祈禱有足夠的力量說出，'因為我愛她，我們是一體，我們一起站立或一起倒下。'"</p>
<p>"But she is sweet, and pure, and true, and brave, and<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00169" title="129"><a id="Page_129" title="129"></a></span> noble-hearted,
and there is no fault in her, or she would not be the daughter of her
father, who was the noblest man I ever knew or ever expect to know. No,
the root of the separation is in myself, in myself only, in my
circumstances and the personal situation I find myself in.</p><p>"但她是甜蜜的，純潔的，真實的，勇敢的，高尚的，並且沒有任何過錯，否則她不會是她父親的女兒，他是我所認識的最高尚的人，或者我期待認識的人。不，分離的根源在於我自己，只在於我自己，在我的情況和我所處的個人狀況中。</p>
<p>"And yet it is difficult for me to state the obstacle which divides us,
or to say more about it than that it is permanent and insurmountable. I
should deceive myself if I tried to believe that time would remove or
lessen it, and I have contended in vain with feelings which have tempted
me to hold on at any price to the only joy and happiness of my life.</p><p>"然而，對我來說，要陳述我們之間的障礙是有困難的，或者關於它的更多說法無非是它是永恆的，無法逾越的。如果我嘗試相信時間會消除或減少它，那我就是在欺騙自己，我無法成功地抗衡那些誘使我無論付出什麼代價都要堅持我生命中唯一的快樂和幸福的感覺。"</p>
<p>"To go to her and open my heart is impossible, for personal intercourse
is precisely the peril I am trying to avoid. How weak I am in her
company! Even when her dress touches me at passing, I am thrilled with
an emotion I cannot master; and when she lifts her large bright eyes to
mine, I am the slave of a passion which conquers all my will.</p><p>"去找她，敞開我的心扉是不可能的，因為私人交往正是我努力避免的危險。在她的陪伴下，我是何等的虛弱！甚至當她的衣裳在過去時接觸到我，我都會被一種我無法掌控的情感所震撼；而當她將那雙明亮大眼睛揚向我的時候，我就成了一個被所有意志所征服的激情的奴隸。"</p>
<p>"No, it is not lightly and without cause that I have taken a step which
sacrifices love to duty. I love her, with all my heart and soul and
strength I love her, and that is why she and I, for her sake more than
mine, should never meet again.</p><p>"不，我做出這樣的決定，並未輕率無故，將愛情犧牲於責任。我愛她，全心全意，用盡我所有的力量愛她，這就是為什麼我們不能再見，更多的是為了她的緣故，而不是我。"</p>

cannot be much concerned about it. There is nobody in London who knows
me in the character I now bear, and can link it to the one you are

<p>The day was fine, and the city was bright with many flags in honour of
the King. All the streets leading from the royal palace to the Hall of
the Deputies were lined with people. The square in front of the
Parliament House was kept clear by a cordon of Carabineers, but the open
windows of the hotels and houses round about were filled with faces.</p><p>那天天氣晴朗，為了向國王致敬，城市裡有許多旗幟讓整個城市光彩奪目。所有從皇宮通往代議院的街道都擠滿了人群。議會大廈前的廣場由一圈卡拉賓槍手們保護著，讓廣場保持通順。而周邊飯店和房子的開窗處則密密麻麻地充滿了臉龐。</p>
<p>David Rossi entered the house by the little private door for deputies in
the side street. The chamber was already thronged, and as full of
movement as a hive of bees. Ladies in light dresses, soldiers in
uniform, diplomatists wearing<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00171" title="130"><a id="Page_130" title="130"></a></span> decorations, senators and deputies in
white cravats and gloves, were moving to their places and saluting each
other with bows and smiles.</p><p>“大衛·羅西從側街的議員專用小門進入了房子。會議室已經擠滿了人，熙熙攘攘如同蜂巢。身著淺色裙子的女士，著裝整齊的士兵，佩戴著獎章的外交官，以及身著白色領帶和手套的參議員和議員們正在各自找到座位並互相行禮微笑著。”</p>
<p>Rossi slipped into the place he usually occupied among the deputies. It
was the corner seat by the door on the left of the royal canopy,
immediately facing the section, which had been apportioned to the Court
tribune. He did not lift his eyes as he entered, but he was conscious of
a tall, well-rounded yet girlish figure in a grey dress that glistened
in a ray of sunshine, with dark hair under a large black hat, and
flashing eyes that seemed to pierce into his own like a shaft of light.</p><p>羅西滑進他通常在議員中佔領的位置。那是王座左邊門口的角落座位，正對著被分配給法庭講壇的區域。當他進來時，他沒有抬起眼睛，但他意識到有一個高大、飽滿而稚氣未脫的女孩身影在日光下閃閃發光的灰色連衣裙中，大黑帽下的黑色秀髮，閃爍的眼睛似乎像光束一樣刺穿他的眼睛。</p>
<p>Beautiful ladies with big oriental eyes were about her, and young
deputies were using their opera-glasses upon them with undisguised
curiosity. There was much gossip, some laughter, and a good deal of
gesticulation. The atmosphere was one of light spirits, approaching
gaiety, the atmosphere of the theatre or the ballroom.</p><p>周遭有著東方大眼睛的美麗女士，年輕的代議員對她們毫不掩飾地好奇地使用了他們的望遠鏡。有許多閒聊，一些笑聲，以及大量的手勢。氛圍是輕鬆愉快的，接近歡樂，就像劇院或舞廳的氣氛。</p>
<p>The clock over the reporters' gallery showed seven minutes after the
hour appointed, when the walls of the chamber shook with the vibration
of a cannon-shot. It was a gun fired at the Castle of St. Angelo to
announce the King's arrival. At the same moment there came the muffled
strains of the royal hymn played by the band in the piazza. The little
gales of gossip died down in an instant, and in dead silence the
assembly rose to its feet.</p><p>記者席上方的鐘顯示出比預定時間晚了七分鐘，此時議會大廳的牆壁被一聲炮響震動。這是在聖安吉洛城堡發射的炮彈，用以宣佈國王的抵達。與此同時，廣場上樂隊演奏的皇家頌歌緩緩傳來。一股小風口吹熄了所有八卦，眾人在鴉雀無聲中起立。</p>
<p>A minute afterwards the King entered amid a fanfare of trumpets, the
shouts of many voices, and the clapping of hands. He was a young man, in
the uniform of a general, with a face that was drawn into deep lines
under the eyes by ill-health and anxiety. Two soldiers, carrying their
brass helmets with waving plumes, walked by his side, and a line of his
Ministers followed. His Queen, a tall and beautiful girl, came behind,
surrounded by many ladies.</p><p>一分鐘後，國王在喇叭的鳴響、眾人的喊聲和掌聲中進入。他是一位年輕的將軍，因為健康狀況不好和憂慮的緣故，臉上的眼下部分已經深深地繪了線條。兩位士兵，揹著他們波浪狀的羽毛盔，走在他身邊，一排他的大臣隨後跟上。他的皇后，一個高大而美麗的女孩，被許多女士們包圍著，走在後面。</p>
<p>The King took his seat under the baldacchino, with his Ministers on his
left. The Queen sat on his right hand, with her ladies beside her. They
bowed to the plaudits of the assembly, and the drawn face of the young
King wore a painful smile.</p><p>國王坐在 baldacchino 底下，他的大臣們在他左邊。皇后坐在他的右邊，她的女侍在她身邊。他們對集會的掌聲鞠躬，年輕的國王的臉上露出痛苦的微笑。</p>
<p>The Baron Bonelli, in court dress and decorations, stood at the King's
elbow, calm, dignified, self-possessed—the one strong face and figure
in the group under the canopy. After the cheering and the shouting had
subsided he requested the<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00172" title="131"><a id="Page_131" title="131"></a></span> assembly, at the command of His Majesty, to
resume their seats. Then he handed a paper to the King.</p><p>男爵邦內利，身穿法庭禮服，頭戴獎章，站在國王的肘膝旁，沉著、高尚、自我擁有，他是帳篷下群眾中的一個堅強的臉孔和形象。在歡呼和叫喊聲稍息後，他按照陛下的命令，要求大會恢復座位。然後，他遞給國王一張紙。</p>
<p>It was the King's speech to his Parliament, and he read it nervously in
a voice that had not learned to control itself. But the speech was
sufficiently emphatic, and its words were grandiose and even florid.</p><p>那是國王向他的議會致辭，他用一種還未學會控制的聲音緊張地讀出來。但這篇演說足夠強調，其詞語華麗甚至繁複。</p>
<p>It consisted of four clauses. In the first clause the King thanked God
that his country was on terms of amity with all foreign countries, and
invoked God's help in the preservation of peace. The second clause was
about the increase of the army.</p><p>它包含四條款。在第一條款中，國王感謝上帝，他的國家與所有外國國家保持友好，並祈求上帝的幫助以維護和平。第二條款是關於增加軍隊的。</p>
<p>"The army," said the King, "is very dear to me, as it has always been
dear to my family. My illustrious grandfather, who granted freedom to
the kingdom, was a soldier; my honoured father was a soldier, and it is
my pride that I am myself a soldier also. The army was the foundation of
our liberty and it is now the security of our rights. On the strength
and stability of the army rest the power of our nation abroad and the
authority of our institutions at home. It is my firm resolve to maintain
the army in the future as my illustrious ancestors have maintained it in
the past, and therefore my Government will propose a bill which is
intended to increase still further its numbers and its efficiency."</p><p>“軍隊，”國王說，“對我來說非常重要，就像對我的家人一樣一直很重要。我那偉大的祖父，他賦予了王國自由，他是一名士兵；我的敬愛的父親也是士兵，我自豪的是我自己也是一名士兵。軍隊是我們自由的基石，現在是我們權利的保障。國家在海外的力量與國內制度的權威都取決於軍隊的實力和穩定性。我堅定的決心是將軍隊繼續維持如同我偉大的祖先們在過去維持的方式，因此我的政府將提出一個法案，目的是進一步增加它的人數和提高其效率。”</p>
<p>This was received with a great outburst of applause and the waving of
many handkerchiefs. It was observed that some of the ladies shed tears.</p><p>這個訊息引起了一場熱烈的掌聲和大量的手帕揮動。有人觀察到某些女士們掉下了淚水。</p>
<p>The third clause was about the growth and spread of anarchism.</p><p>"第三條款是關於無政府主義的發展和擴散。"</p>
<p>"My house," said the King, "gave liberty to the nation, and now it is my
duty and my hope to give security and strength. It is known to
Parliament that certain subversive elements, not in Italy alone, but
throughout Europe, throughout the world, have been using the most
devilish machinations for the destruction of all order, human and
divine. Cold, calculating criminals have perpetrated crimes against the
most innocent and the most highly placed, which have sent a thrill of
horror into all humane hearts. My Government asks for an absolute power
over such criminals, and if we are to bring security to the State, we
must reinvigorate the authority to which society trusts the high mandate
of protecting and governing."</p><p>"我的家族,"國王說, "給予國家自由，現在我有責任和希望為這個國家帶來安全和力量。國會已知道，在整個歐洲，乃至全世界，有一些顛覆性的元素已利用最邪惡的計謀來破壞所有秩序，無論是人類或神聖的。冷酷且精密的罪犯對最無辜和高位的人犯下罪行，這讓所有富有人道心的人都感到驚愕。我們政府希望對這樣的罪犯有絕對的管控權力，若要為國家帶來安全，我們必須恢復社會賦予保護和管理高命的權力。"</p>
<p>A still greater outburst of cheering interrupted the young King, who
raised his head amid the shouts, the clapping of<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00173" title="132"><a id="Page_132" title="132"></a></span> hands, and the
fluttering of handkerchiefs, and smiled his painful smile.</p><p>一陣更大的歡呼聲打斷了年輕國王的話語，他在喝采聲、拍手聲和擺動的手帕聲中抬起了頭，露出了他痛苦的微笑。</p>
<p>"More than that," continued the King, "I have to deplore the spread of
associations, sodalities, and clubs, which, by an erroneous conception
of liberty, are disseminating the germs of revolt against the State.
Under the most noble propositions about the moral and economical
redemption of the people is hidden a propaganda for the conquest of the
public powers.</p><p>"除此之外,"國王繼續說道, "我必須對各種社團、組織和俱樂部的擴張表示遺憾，他們對自由的錯誤認知，正在散播反抗國家的暴動種子。在大部分關於人民道德和經濟救贖的崇高理念下，隱藏著對公共權力的征服宣傳。"</p>
<p>"My aim is to gain the affection of my people, and to interest them in
the cause of order and public security, and therefore my Government will
present an urgent bill, which is intended to stop the flowering of these
parasitic organisations, by revising these laws of the press and of
public meeting, in whose defects agitators find opportunity for their
attacks on the doctrines of the State."</p><p>"我的目標是獲得人民的愛戴，並使他們對秩序和公共安全的事業感興趣，因此，我的政府將提出一項迫切的法案，該法案旨在透過修訂新聞法和公共集會法來阻止這些寄生機構的過度發揮，激進份子就是在這些法律的缺陷中找到攻擊國家理念的機會。"
</p>
<p>A prolonged outburst of applause followed this passage, mingled with a
tumult of tongues, which went on after the King had begun to read again,
rendering his last clause—an invocation of God's blessing on the
deliberations of Parliament—almost inaudible.</p><p>這段話後隨著一陣延長的掌聲，並混雜著一片口哮聲，即使國王開始再次朗讀，也沒能停止，這使得他最後一句話——祈求上帝祝福議會的討論——幾乎無法聽見。</p>
<p>The end of the speech was a signal for further cheering, and when the
King left the hall, bowing as before, and smiling his painful smile, the
shouts of "Long live the King," the clapping of hands, and the waving of
handkerchiefs followed him to the street. The entire ceremony had
occupied twelve minutes.</p><p>演講結束是進一步歡呼的訊號，當國王像以前一樣鞠躬，並帶著他痛苦的微笑離開大廳時，"國王萬歲"的聲音，拍手聲，和揮舞手帕的人們跟隨他至街上。整個儀式佔用了十二分鐘。</p>
<p>Then the clamour of voices drowned the sound of the royal hymn outside.
Deputies were climbing about to join their friends among the ladies,
whose light laughter was to be heard on every side.</p><p>然後，嘈雜的聲音蓋過了外面皇家頌歌的聲音。議員們正在四處攀爬，欲與女士們中的朋友會合，到處都可以聽到她們的輕盈笑聲。</p>
<p>David Rossi rose to go. Without lifting his head, he had been conscious
that during the latter part of the King's speech many eyes were fixed
upon him. Playing with his watch-chain, he had struggled to look calm
and impassive. But his heart was sick, and he wished to get away
quickly.</p><p>大衛·羅西起身離開。在國王演講的後半部分，他頭未抬起，卻意識到許多眼睛都在注視著他。他玩弄著手中的錶鏈，努力保持冷靜和無動於衷的樣子。但他的心病了，他希望快點離開。</p>
<p>A partition, shielding the door of the corridor, stood near to his seat,
and he was trying to get round it. He heard his name in the air around
him, mingled with significant trills and unmistakable accents. All at
once he was conscious of a perfume he knew, and of a girlish figure
facing him.</p><p>一塊劃分牆，遮住了通道門附近的座位，他試圖走到牆的另一邊。他聽到空氣中響起他的名字，夾雜著標誌性的顫音和無誤的口音。突然間，他意識到了熟悉的香味，並看到一個少女的身影出現在他面前。</p>
<p>"Good-day, Honourable," said a voice that thrilled him like the strings
of a harp drawn tight.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00174" title="133"><a id="Page_133" title="133"></a></span></p><p>"您好，尊敬的先生，"一個聲音讓他感到如同緊繃的豎琴絃般心潮澎湃。</p>
<p>He lifted his head and answered. It was Roma. Her face was lighted up
with a fire he had never seen before. Only one glance he dared to take,
but he could see that at the next instant those flashing eyes would
burst into tears.</p><p>他抬起頭來回答。是羅馬。她的臉上燃燒著他從未見過的火光。他只敢瞥一眼，但他知道下一瞬間，那雙閃亮的眼睛就要溢出淚水。</p>
<p>The tide was passing out by the front doors where the carriages and the
reporters waited, but Rossi stepped round to the back. He was on the way
to the office of his newspaper, and dipping into the Corso from a lane
that crossed it, he came upon the King's carriage returning to the
Quirinal. It was entirely surrounded by soldiers, the military commander
of Rome on the right, the commander of the Carabineers on the left, and
the Cuirassiers, riding two deep, before and behind, so that the King
and Queen were scarcely visible to the cheering crowd. Last in the royal
procession came an ordinary cab containing two detectives in plain
clothes.</p><p>潮汐正在前門處退去，那裡有馬車和記者等待，但羅西卻繞到了後面。他正在前往他的報社辦公室，從一條穿過科蘇街的小巷中鑽出，他碰到了國王的馬車正在返回奎里納爾宮。馬車完全被士兵包圍，羅馬的軍事司令官在右邊，憲兵司令官在左邊，而鐵甲兵則是兩排騎在前面和後面，使得國王和王后在歡呼的人群中幾乎看不見。在王室行列的最後，是一輛普通的出租車，車裡有兩位便衣偵探。</p>
<p>The office of the <i>Sunrise</i> was in a narrow lane out of the Corso. It
was a dingy building of three floors, with the machine-rooms on the
ground-level, the composing-rooms at the top, and the editorial rooms
between. Rossi's office was a large apartment, with three desks, that
were intended for the editor and his day and night assistants.</p><p>太陽報的辦公室位於科索街的一個狹窄巷子裡。這是一棟陰暗的三層建築，機器房位於地面層，排版房位於頂層，編輯室則位於中間。羅西的辦公室是一間大公寓，裡面有三張桌子，分別供編輯和他的日夜助手們使用。</p>
<p>His day assistant received him with many bows and compliments. He was a
small man with an insincere face.</p><p>他的日常助手以許多鞠躬和讚美迎接他。他是一個面帶虛偽表情的小個子男人。</p>
<p>Rossi drank a cup of coffee and settled to his work. It was an article
on the day's doings, more fearless and outspoken than he had ever
published before. Such a day as they had just gone through, with the
flying of flags and the playing of royal hymns, was not really a day of
joy and rejoicing, but of degradation and shame. If the people had known
what they were doing, they would have hung their flags with crape and
played funeral marches.</p><p>羅西喝了一杯咖啡，然後全神貫注地開始他的工作。他正在寫一篇關於當天事情的文章，這比他以前發布的任何文章都更無畏和直言不諱。他們剛剛經歷的那一天，隨著旗幟飄揚和皇家頌歌的演奏，實際上並不是一個歡樂和喜慶的日子，而是一個屈辱和恥辱的日子。如果人們知道他們正在做什麼，他們會將他們的旗幟配上黑紗，並奏葬禮進行曲。</p>
<p>"Such a scene as we have witnessed to-day," he wrote, "like all such
scenes throughout the world, whether in Germany, Russia, and England, or
in China, Persia, and the darkest regions of Africa, is but proof of the
melancholy fact that while man, as the individual, has been nineteen
hundred years converted to Christianity, man, as the nation, remains to
this day for the most part utterly pagan."</p><p>"諸如我們今天所見證的場面，"他寫道，"無論是在德國、俄羅斯、英國或中國、波斯、以及非洲的最黑暗地區，全世界的類似場面都只是證明這個悲哀的事實，那就是雖然作為個體的人類已經接受了一千九百年的基督教，然而作為國家的人類至今大部分都仍然完全是異教的。"</p>
<p>The assistant editor, who had glanced over the pages of manuscript as
Rossi threw them aside, looked up at last and said:</p><p>"助理編輯在羅西把稿子一頁頁丟在一邊時瞥了一眼，最後抬頭說："</p>
<p>"Are you sure, sir, that you wish to print this article?"</p><p>"先生，您確定要複印這篇文章嗎？"</p>
<p>"Quite sure."<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00175" title="134"><a id="Page_134" title="134"></a></span></p><p>"相當確定。"</p>
<p>The man made a shrug of his shoulders, and took the copy upstairs.</p><p>那個男人聳了聳肩，然後把副本拿到樓上。</p>
<p>The short day had closed in when Rossi was returning home. Screamers in
the streets were crying early editions of the evening papers, and the
cafés in the Corso were full of officers and civilians, sipping vermouth
and reading glowing accounts of the King's enthusiastic reception.
Pitiful! Most pitiful! And the man who dared to tell the truth must be
prepared for any consequences.</p><p>短暫的一天即將結束，羅西正在返回家中。街上的喊叫者正在吶喊晚報的提前版，科索大道上的咖啡館充滿了軍官和平民，他們正品嚐著苦艾酒，並讀著有關國王熱烈歡迎的報道。可悲！太可悲了！而敢於說出真相的人必須做好面對任何後果的準備。</p>
<p>David Rossi told himself that he <i>was</i> prepared. Henceforth he would
devote himself to the people, without a thought of what might happen.
Nothing should come between him and his work—nothing whatever—not
even ... but, no, he could not think of it!</p><p>"大衛·羅西告訴自己他已經做好準備。從此，他將無私為民務，不去想可能會發生什麼。沒有任何事情應該阻礙他和他的工作 - 絕對沒有 - 甚至... 但是，不，他不能去想它！"</p>
<h3 id="pgepubid00176">VI</h3>
<p>Two letters were awaiting David Rossi in his rooms at home.</p><p>在他的家中，大衛·羅西等待著兩封信。</p>
<p>One was a circular from the President of the Chamber of Deputies
summoning Parliament for the day after to-morrow to elect officials and
reply to the speech of the King.</p><p>"以下是來自眾議院主席的公告，召集國會在後天選舉官員並回應國王的演講。"</p>
<p>The other was from Roma, and the address was in a large, hurried hand.
David Rossi broke the seal with nervous fingers.</p><p>另一個來自羅馬的。地址用大字為匆忙地書寫。大衛·羅西用緊張的手指打開封蠟。</p>
<p style="padding-top:.5em;">"<span class="smcap">My dear Friend</span>,—I know! I know! I know now what the obstacle is.
B. gave me the hint of it on one of the days of last week, when I was so
anxious to see you and you did not come. It is your unflinching devotion
to your mission and to your public duties. You are one of those who
think that when a man has dedicated his life to work for the world, he
should give up everything else—father, mother, wife, child—and live
like a priest, who puts away home, and love, and kindred, that others
may have them more abundantly. I can understand that, and see a sort of
nobility in it too, especially in days when the career of a statesman is
only a path to vainglory of every kind. It is great, it is glorious, it
thrills me to think of it.</p><p style="padding-top:.5em;">"親愛的朋友，我知道了！我知道了！我現在知道什麼是阻礙了。B.在上週的某一天給了我一個暗示，那天我急切地想見到你，但你並未來。 是你對你的使命和公眾職責的堅定奉獻。你是那些認為一個人一旦將他的生活獻給為世界工作，他應該放棄所有其他事物——父親、母親、妻子、孩子——並像一位牧師一樣生活，把家庭、愛情和親屬放在一邊，讓其他人更豐富地擁有他們。我可以理解這一點，並且也看到它的某種高尚之處，特別是在政客的職業只是通向各種虛榮的道路的日子裡。它是偉大的，是光榮的，想到它就讓我激動."</p>
<p>"But I am losing faith in my unknown sister that is to be, in spite of
all my pleading. You say she is beautiful—that's<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00177" title="135"><a id="Page_135" title="135"></a></span> well enough, but it
comes by nature. You say she is sweet, and true, and charming—and I am
willing to take it all on trust. But when you say she is noble-hearted I
respectfully refuse to believe it. If she were that, you would be sure
that she would know that friendship is the surest part of love, and to
be the friend of a great man is to be a help to him, and not an
impediment.</p><p>"但是，我對那個我完全不認識的未來妹妹正逐漸失去信心，儘管我已經百般哀求。你說她很美，這當然挺好，但這是天生的。你說她甜美、真誠且有魅力，我願意全盤接受。但是當你說她心胸寬大的時候，我禮貌地不敢相信。假如她真的如此，你就會確信她會懂得，友誼是愛情中最穩定的部分，成為一個偉大的人的朋友意味著是他的助人，而不是阻礙。"</p>
<p>"My gracious! What does she think you are? A <i>cavaliere servente</i> to
dance attendance on her ladyship day and night? Give me the woman who
wants her husband to be a man, with a man's work to do, a man's burdens
to bear, and a man's triumphs to win.</p><p>"天啊!她把你當成什麼了? 難道是個全天候服侍她的僕人嗎? 我喜歡的女人視丈夫為真正的男人，有男人該做的工作，承受男人的負擔，獲得男人的勝利。"</p>
<p>"Yet perhaps I am too hard on my unknown sister that is to be, or ought
to be, and it is only your own distrust that wrongs her. If she is the
daughter of one brave man and really loves another, she knows her place
and her duty. It is to be ready to follow her husband wherever he must
go, to share his fate whatever it may be, and to live his life, because
it is now her own.</p><p>"也許我對我未知的姐妹太苛刻了，或者應該是，只是你自己的不信任傷害了她。如果她是一位勇士的女兒，而且真的愛著另一個人，她知道她的位置和她的職責。那就是準備隨時跟隨她的丈夫走到他必須去的任何地方，分享他可能面對的命運，並過他的生活，因為那現在是她自己的。"</p>
<p>"And since I am in the way of pleading for her again, let me tell you
how simple you are to suppose that because you have never disclosed your
secret she may never have guessed it. Goodness me! To think that men who
can make women love them to madness itself can be so ignorant as not to
know that a woman can always tell if a man loves her, and even fix the
very day, and hour, and minute when he looked into her eyes and loved
her first.</p><p>"既然我又在為她辯護，那就讓我告訴你，你是多麼地簡單，以至於你認為由於你從未透露你的秘密，她就可能永遠無法猜到。天哪！想想看，那些能讓女人愛到瘋狂的男人竟然如此無知，不知道一個女人總是能告訴如果一個男人愛她，甚至可以確定他什麼時候第一次看她的眼睛並愛上她的準確日，時，分。"</p>
<p>"And if my unknown sister that ought to be knows that you love her, be
sure that she loves you in return. Then trust her. Take the counsel of a
woman and go to her. Remember, that if you are suffering by this
separation, perhaps she is suffering too, and if she is worthy of the
love and friendship of a better man than you are, or ever hope to be
(which, without disparaging her ladyship, I respectfully refuse to
believe), let her at least have the refusal of one or both of them.</p><p>"如果我那認識不詳的妹妹知道你愛她，相信她也會回報你的愛。所以，相信她。聆聽一位女性的建議，去找她吧。請記住，如果你因為分開而痛苦，也許她也一樣痛苦；如果她值得一個比你更好的男人的愛和友誼，或者你希望成為那樣的人（我尊重地拒絕相信這點，而且沒有貶低她的意思），就讓她至少有拒絕其中一個或兩個的權利。"</p>
<p>"Good-night! I go to the Chamber of Deputies again the day after
to-morrow, being so immersed in public matters (and public men) that I
can think of nothing else at present. Happily my bust is out of hand,
and the caster (not B. this time) is hard at work on it.</p><p>"晚安！我後天再次前往眾議院，現在我全身心都投入在公共事務（和公眾人物）中，我現在無法想到其他的事情。幸好我的半身像已經完成，而且進行鑄造的工人（這次不是B.）正在努力工作中。"</p>
<p>"You won't hear anything about the M—— doings, yet I assure you they
are a most serious matter. Unless I am<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00178" title="136"><a id="Page_136" title="136"></a></span> much mistaken there is an effort
on foot to connect you with my father, which is surely sufficiently
alarming. M—— is returning to Rome, and I hear rumours of an intention

identification. Think of it, I beg, I pray!—Your friend,</p><p>"你可能還沒聽說關於M進行的事情，但我保證這是一件非常嚴重的事情。除非我大錯特錯，否則一定有人正努力將你和我父親聯絡起來，這無疑是足夠令人驚慌的。 M將返回羅馬，我聽說有意圖對這裡的某人施加壓力，希望能夠促使其進行身份證明。我請求，我祈禱你要認真對待這個問題！ -你的朋友"</p>

<h3 id="pgepubid00179">VII</h3>
<p>Next day Rossi's editorial assistant came with a troubled face. There
was bad news from the office. The morning's edition of the <i>Sunrise</i> had
been confiscated by the police owing to the article on the King's speech
and procession. The proprietors of the paper were angry with their
editor, and demanded to see him immediately.</p><p>"隔天，羅西的編輯助理帶著煩惱的臉孔來到。辦公室那邊有壞消息。由於報導了國王的演說和遊行，當天早上的《日出》版面被警方沒收了。該報的負責人對他們的編輯感到憤怒，並要求立即見到他。"</p>
<p>"Tell them I'll be at the office at four o'clock, as usual," said Rossi,
and he sat down to write a letter.</p><p>"告訴他們我會像往常一樣在四點鐘到辦公室," Rossi說，然後他坐下來寫一封信。</p>
<p>It was to Roma. The moment he took up the pen to write to her the air of
the room seemed to fill with a sweet feminine presence that banished
everything else. It was like talking to her. She was beside him. He
could hear her soft replies.</p><p>他寫信給羅馬的那一刻，房間的氣氛似乎被一種甜美的女性氣息所充滿，其他的一切都被驅逐了出去。這就像在跟她談話一樣。她就在他身邊。他可以聽到她的溫柔回答。</p>
<p style="padding-top:.5em;">"If it were possible to heighten the pain of my feelings when I decided
to sacrifice my best wishes to my sense of duty, a letter like your last
would be more than I could bear. The obstacle you deal with is not the
one which chiefly weighs with me, but it is a very real impediment, not
altogether disposed of by the sweet and tender womanliness with which
you put it aside. In that regard what troubles me most is the hideous
inequality between what the man gives and what he gets, and the splendid
devotion with which the woman merges her life in the life of the man she
marries only quickens the sense of his selfishness in allowing himself
to accept so great a prize.</p><p style="padding-top:.5em;">"如果可以讓我在決定為了盡責捨棄我最美好的願望時的感情痛苦加深，像你最後一封信這樣的信會讓我無法承受。你處理的障礙並不是我主要考慮的，但它是一個非常真實的阻礙，你以甜美和嬌嫩的女性氣質將其放在一旁，這並沒有完全消除它。在這個問題上，我最困擾的是男人付出與得到的可怕不均等，以及女人如何用壯麗的奉獻將她的生活融入她嫁給的男人的生活，這只是加劇了他允許自己接受如此巨大獎品的自私感。"</p>
<p>"In my own case, the selfishness, if I yielded to it, would be greater
far than anybody else could be guilty of, and of all men who have
sacrificed women's lives to their own career, I should feel myself to be
the most guilty and inexcusable. My dear and beloved girl is nobly born,
and lives in wealth and luxury, while I am poor—poor by choice, and
therefore poor for ever, brought up as a foundling, and without a name
that I dare call my own.</p><p>"在我的情況下，如果我屈服於自私，那將遠超過其他任何人可能犯下的罪過，而且在所有為了自己的事業而犧牲女性生命的男人中，我會認為自己最為有罪和無可辯護。我的愛人與至愛是高貴出生，生活在豐富和奢華之中，而我卻是貧窮的——出於選擇而貧窮，因此永遠貧窮，自小被撫養長大，而沒有一個我敢稱之為自己的名字。"</p>
<p>"What then? Shall such a man as I am ask such a woman<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00180" title="137"><a id="Page_137" title="137"></a></span> as she is to come
into the circle of his life, to exchange her riches for his poverty, her
comfort for his suffering? No.</p><p>"那麼呢？像我這樣的男人，是否應該請求像她這樣的女人進入他的生活圈子，將她的富裕換成他的貧窮，將她的舒適換成他的苦難？不。"</p>
<p>"Besides, what woman could do it if I did? Women can be unselfish, they
can be faithful, they can be true; but—don't ask me to say things I do
not want to say—women love wealth and luxury and ease, and shrink from
pain and poverty and the forced marches of a hunted life. And why
shouldn't they? Heaven spare them all such sufferings as men alone
should bear!</p><p>"此外，即使我能做到，有什麼女人能做到呢？女人可以無私，可以忠誠，可以真實；但是——不要讓我說不想說的話——女人熱愛財富和奢侈，喜歡安逸，卻痛恨痛苦，貧窮，以及被追捕生活的強制行軍。她們為什麼不應該呢？願天堂保佑她們免受所有這樣的痛苦，這些痛苦只應由男人來承受！"</p>
<p>"Yet all this is still outside the greater obstacle which stands between
me and the dear girl from whom I must separate myself now, whatever it
may cost me, as an inexorable duty. I entreat you to spare me the pain
of explaining further. Believe that for her sake my resolution, in spite
of all your sweet and charming pleading, is strong and unalterable.</p><p>"然而，所有這些都仍然是在我與我現在必須不顧一切代價與之分離的那個可愛的女孩之間更大的障礙之外。我懇求你能夠免去我再進一步說明的痛苦。相信為了她的緣故，儘管你的甜美和迷人的懇求，我的決心仍然堅定不移。"</p>
<p>"Only one thing more. If it is as you say it may be, that she loves me,
though I had no right to believe so, that will only add to my
unhappiness in thinking of the wrench that she must suffer. But she is
strong, she is brave, she is the daughter of her father, and I have
faith in the natural power of her mind, in her youth and the chances of
life for one so beautiful and so gifted, to remove the passing
impression that may have been made.</p><p>"只還有一件事。如果事情真如你所說，她愛我，即使我以前無權這麼認為，這只會增加我對她必然感受到的心痛的不快。但是，她很堅強，很勇敢，她是她父親的女兒，我對她的神智天賦，她的青春以及身為如此美麗和才華橫溢的人對生活的期待有信心，能夠消除可能造成的暫時影響。"</p>
<p>"Good-bye yet again! And God bless you!</p><p>"再一次告別！願神保佑你！"</p>

<p>Before two o'clock next day the Chamber of Deputies was already full.
The royal chair and baldacchino had been removed, and their place was
occupied by the usual bench of the President.</p><p>在次日兩點之前，眾議院已經坐滿了人。皇家的椅子和 baldacchino 已被移走，它們的位置現在被總統的常規座位所佔據。</p>
<p>When the Prime Minister took his place, cool, collected, smiling,
faultlessly dressed and wearing a flower in his button-hole, he was
greeted with some applause from the members, and the dry rustle of fans
in the ladies' tribune was distinctly heard. The leader of the
Opposition had a less marked reception, and when David Rossi glided
round the partition<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00182" title="138"><a id="Page_138" title="138"></a></span> to his place on the extreme Left, there was a
momentary hush, followed by a buzz of voices.</p><p>當首相冷靜、沉著、微笑地坐到他的座位上，衣著無懈可擊且胸針上別著一朵花時，他受到了一些議員的歡迎，並且能清楚地聽到女士看臺上扇子的沙沙聲。反對黨領袖的接待較不明顯，而當大衛·羅西滑過隔板走向左邊的極端位置時，會場一度陷入安靜，接著是聲音的嘩然。</p>
<p>Then the President of the Chamber entered, with his secretaries about
him, and took his seat in a central chair under a bust of the young
King. Ushers, wearing a linen band of red, white, and green on their
arms, followed with portfolios, and with little trays containing
water-bottles and glasses. Conversation ceased, and the President rang a
hand-bell that stood by his side, and announced that the sitting was
begun.</p><p>接著，議會的主席與他的秘書們進場，在青年國王的半身像下的中央椅子上就座。隨後順次入場的是掌櫃們，他們手臂上戴著紅白綠三色的亞麻帶，帶著文件包，並帶著裝有水瓶和酒杯的小盤子。話語聲音停息，主席鳴響了他旁邊的手鈴，宣佈會議已經開始。</p>
<p>The first important business of the day was the reply to the speech of
the King, and the President called on the member who had been appointed
to undertake this duty. A young Deputy, a man of letters, then made his
way to a bar behind the chairs of the Ministers and read from a printed
paper a florid address to the sovereign.</p><p>"當天首要的公務是回覆國王的演說，會長呼叫被指派負責這項工作的議員。然後，一位年輕的副議員，一位學問人士，走到部長椅子後面的吧檯，從印刷的紙碎上，朗讀對君主的華麗致詞。"</p>
<p>Having read his printed document, the Deputy proceeded to move the
adoption of the reply.</p><p>在閱讀完他的印刷文件後，副議員開始推動答覆的採納。</p>
<p>With the proposal of the King and the Government to increase the army he
would not deal. It required no recommendation. The people were patriots.
They loved their country, and would spend the last drop of their blood
to defend it. The only persons who were not with the King in his desire
to uphold the army were the secret foes of the nation and the
dynasty—persons who were in league with their enemies.</p><p>與國王和政府增強軍隊的提議，他不願接受。這不需要任何推薦。人民都是愛國者。他們愛他們的國家，願意用他們最後一滴血來保衛它。唯一不與國王一同希望維護軍隊的人，就是這個國家和王朝的秘密敵人—那些與敵人聯盟的人。</p>
<p>"That," said the speaker, "brings us to the next clause of our reply to
His Majesty's gracious speech. We know that there exists among the
associations aimed at a compact between strangely varying
forces—between the forces of socialism, republicanism, unbelief, and
anarchy, and the forces of the Church and the Vatican."</p><p>"那個，"講者說，"帶我們到下一條我們對國王慈祥演講的回應。我們知道，存在著一些協會旨在為奇特變化的力量之間建立一個協約 - 社會主義，共和主義，無信仰和無政府主義的力量，與教會和梵蒂岡的力量之間。"</p>
<p>At this statement there was a great commotion. Members on the Left
protested with loud shouts of "It is not true," and in a moment the
tongues and arms of the whole assembly were in motion. The President
rang his bell, and the speaker concluded.</p><p>在這種說法之後，會場上出現了一片混亂。左翼的成員大聲抗議說，“那不是真的”，瞬間整個議會的舌頭和手臂都在活動。主席敲鈴，演講者結束了他的講話。</p>
<p>"Let us draw the teeth of both parties to this secret conspiracy, that
they may never again use the forces of poverty and discontent to disturb
public order."</p><p>"讓我們拔去這秘密陰謀的雙方的牙齒，使他們永遠不能再利用貧困和不滿的力量來破壞公共秩序。"</p>
<p>When the speaker sat down, his friends thronged around him to shake
hands with him and congratulate him.</p><p>當演講者坐下時，他的朋友們圍繞他，握手並祝賀他。</p>
<p>Then the eyes of the House and of the audience in the gallery turned to
David Rossi. He had sat with folded arms<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00183" title="139"><a id="Page_139" title="139"></a></span> and head down while his
followers screamed their protests. But passing a paper to the President,
he now rose and said:</p><p>接著，議會和旁聽席的觀眾的目光都轉向了David Rossi。當他的追隨者大聲抗議的時候，他坐著，雙臂交叉，頭低下來。但他現在遞給總統一份文件，然後站起來說：
</p>
<p>"I ask permission to propose an amendment to the reply to the King's
speech."</p><p>"我請求許可提出對國王演講的回應的修正案。"</p>
<p>"You have the word," said the President.</p><p>"你有話要說,"總統說。</p>
<p>David Rossi read his amendment. At the feet of His Majesty it humbly
expressed an opinion that the present was not a time at which fresh
burdens should be laid upon the country for the support of the army,
with any expectation that they could be borne. Misfortune and suffering
had reached their climax. The cup of the people was full.</p><p>"大衛·羅西讀出他的修正案。在國王的腳下，他謙卑地表達了一種觀點，即現在不是一個為了支援軍隊而應該向國家施加新的負擔的時期，可期待這些負擔能夠承受。不幸和苦難已達到了頂點。人民的苦杯已經滿溢。"</p>
<p>At this language some of the members laughed. There were cries of
"Order" and "Shame," and then the laughter was resumed. The President
rang his bell, and at length silence was secured. David Rossi began to
speak, in a voice that was firm and resolute.</p><p>在這種語言裡，有些成員笑了出來。有人大叫"秩序"和"羞恥"，然後笑聲又再次響起。主席敲響他的鈴，最終得到了寂靜。大衛·羅西開始以堅決有力的聲音發表演說。</p>
<p>"If," he said, "the statement that members of this House are in alliance
with the Pope and the Vatican is meant for me and mine, I give it a flat
denial. And, in order to have done with this calumny once and for ever,
permit me to say that between the Papacy and the people, as represented
by us, there is not, and never can be, anything in common. In temporal
affairs, the theory of the Papacy rejects the theory of the democracy.
The theory of the democracy rejects the theory of the Papacy. The one
claims a divine right to rule in the person of the Pope because he is
Pope. The other denies all divine right except that of the people to
rule themselves."</p><p>"如果"，他說，"這個議會的成員與教皇和梵蒂岡結盟的宣告是針對我和我的人，我堅決否認。為了一勞永逸地結束這種誹謗，允許我說，在我們代表的教皇和人民之間，現在沒有，將來也永遠不會有任何共同點。在世俗事務中，教皇的理論拒絕了民主的理論。民主的理論拒絕了教皇的理論。一個主張教皇有神聖的權利以教皇的身份統治，因為他是教皇。另一個否認所有的神聖權利，除非是人民自我統治的權利。"</p>
<p>This was received with some applause mingled with laughter, and certain
shouts flung out in a shrill hysterical voice. The President rang his
bell again, and David Rossi continued.</p><p>這句話獲得了一些掌聲與笑聲的回應，並伴隨著尖銳而歇斯底里的聲音的叫囂。會議主席再次敲鐘，David Rossi繼續他的演說。</p>
<p>"The proposal to increase the army," he said, "in a time of tranquillity
abroad but of discord at home, is the gravest impeachment that could be
made of the Government of a country. Under a right order of things
Parliament would be the conscience of the people, Government would be
the servant of that conscience, and rebellion would be impossible. But
this Government is the master of the country and is keeping the people
down by violence and oppression. Parliament is dead. For God's sake let
us bury it!"</p><p>"他說，提議在海外太平，但國內混亂的時候增加軍隊，是對一個國家政府可能有的最嚴重的彈劾。在正確的秩序下，國會將是人民的良知，政府將是這種良知的僕人，反叛將是不可能的。但是，這個政府是國家的主人，並運用暴力和壓迫來壓制人民。國會已死。看在上帝的份上，讓我們埋葬它吧！"</p>
<p>Loud shouts followed this outburst, and some of the Deputies rose from
their seats, and crowding about the<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00184" title="140"><a id="Page_140" title="140"></a></span> speaker in the open space in front,
yelled and screamed at him like a pack of hounds. He stood calm, playing
with his watch-chain, while the President rang his bell and called for
silence. The interruptions died down at last, and the speaker went on:</p><p>此爆發之後，大聲的喊叫聲跟隨而來，其中一些代表從他們的座位上站起來，並在前面的開放空間中圍繞著演講者，像一群獵犬般對他吼叫和尖叫。他站立著，平靜地玩弄著他的錶鏈，而主席則敲響他的鐘，呼籲要有秩序。最終，這些中斷聲音漸漸死去，演講者繼續進行：</p>
<p>"If you ask me what is the reason of the discontent which produces the
crimes of anarchism, I say, first, the domination of a Government which
is absolute, and the want of liberty of speech and meeting. In other
countries the discontented are permitted to manifest their woes, and are
not punished unless they commit deeds of violence; but in Italy alone,
except Russia, a man may be placed outside the law, torn from his home,
from the bedside of his nearest and dearest, and sent to <i>domicilio
coatto</i> to live or die in a silence as deep as that of the grave. Oh, I
know what I am saying. I have been in the midst of it. I have seen a
father torn from his daughter, and the motherless child left to the
mercy of his enemies."</p><p>"如果你問我什麼是造成無政府主義犯罪的不滿的原因，我會說，首先，這是因為一個絕對的政府的統治，以及言論和集會的自由的缺乏。在其他國家，不滿的人被允許表達他們的苦衷，並且除非他們犯下暴行，否則不會被懲罰；但在義大利，除了俄羅斯，一個人可能會被法律視為無足輕重，從他的家中被撕走，從他最親密的人的床邊被攆走，並被送到在監獄申請的地方生活或死去，在那裡的寂靜深如墳墓。噢，我知道我在說什麼。我已經處在其中。我看到了一個父親被從他的女兒身邊撕走，母親不在的孩子留給了他的敵人的慈悲。"</p>
<p>This allusion quieted the House, and for a moment there was a dead
silence. Then through the tense air there came a strange sound, and the
President demanded silence from the galleries, whereupon the reporters
rose and made a negative movement of the hand with two fingers upraised,
pointing at the same time to the ladies' tribune.</p><p>這種暗示使眾議院安靜下來，片刻間，沉寂一片。然後，透過緊張的空氣，傳來了一種奇怪的聲音，而主席要求旁聽席保持安靜。於是，記者們起立，並用兩根手指向上作出否定的手勢，同時指向女士看臺。</p>
<p>One of the ladies had cried out. David Rossi heard the voice, and, when
he began again, his own voice was softer and more tremulous.</p><p>其中一位女士叫了出來。大衛·羅西聽到了這個聲音，當他再次開口時，他自己的聲音更加柔和且顫抖。</p>
<p>"Next, I say that the cause of anarchism in Italy, as everywhere else,
is poverty. Wait until the 1st of February, and you shall see such an
army enter Rome as never before invaded it. I assert that within three
miles of this place, at the gates of this capital of Christendom, human
beings are living lives more abject than that of savage man.</p><p>"接下來，我說義大利的無政府主義之因，就如其他地方一樣，是貧窮。等到二月一日，你將看到一支前所未有的大軍進入羅馬。我斷言，在這個地方的三英里之內，在基督教世界的這個首都的門口，有人類的生活比野蠻人還要悲慘。"</p>
<p>"Housed in huts of straw, sleeping on mattresses of leaves, clothed in
rags or nearly nude, fed on maize and chestnuts and acorns, worked
eighteen hours a day, and sweated by the tyranny of the overseers, to
whom landlords lease their lands while they idle their days in the
<i>salons</i> of Rome and Paris, men and women and children are being treated
worse than slaves, and beaten more than dogs."</p><p>"居住在稻草屋中，睡在樹葉墊上，穿著破爛的衣物或幾乎裸體，以玉米和栗子和橡實為食，每天工作十八個小時，並在監工的暴政下辛勤工作，土地所有者將他們的土地租給監工，而他們自己則在羅馬和巴黎的沙龍中虛度時日，男人、女人和孩子被對待得比奴隸還糟，比狗還要打。"</p>
<p>At that there was a terrific uproar, shouts of "It's a lie!" and
"Traitor!" followed by a loud outbreak of jeers and laughter. Then, for
the first time, David Rossi lost control<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00185" title="141"><a id="Page_141" title="141"></a></span> of himself, and, turning upon
Parliament with flaming eyes and quivering voice, he cried:</p><p>"在這之後，場上立刻爆發出劇烈的騷動，人們大叫'這是謊言！'和'叛徒！'接著是一陣嘲笑和笑聲的大爆發。然後， David Rossi首次失控，他眼中閃爍著熾烈的火焰，聲音在顫抖，他對議會大喊："</p>
<p>"You take these statements lightly—you that don't know what it is to be
hungry, you that have food enough to eat, and only want sleep to digest
it. But <i>I</i> know these things by bitter knowledge—by experience. Don't
talk to me, you who had fathers and mothers to care for you, and
comfortable homes to live in. I had none of these. I was nursed in a
poorhouse and brought up in a hut on the Campagna. Because of the
miserable laws of your predecessors my mother drowned herself in the
Tiber, and I knew what it was to starve. And I am only one of many. At
the very door of Rome, under a Christian Government, the poor are living
lives of moral anæmia and physical atrophy more terrible by far than
those which made the pagan poet say two thousand years ago—<i>Paucis
vivit humanum genus</i>—the human race exists for the benefit of the few."</p><p>"你把這些話認為是輕描淡寫——你不知道饑餓是什麼，你有足夠的食物，只需要睡眠來消化它。但我從苦難的知識，從經驗中認識到了這些。不要對我講話，你們有父母照顧你們，有舒適的家，可以住。我沒有這些。我在一個窮人的家裡被照顧，在坎帕尼亞的小屋裡長大。因為你們前任的悲慘的法律，我的母親在蒂伯河中溺水自殺，我知道什麼叫飢荒。而我只是眾多人中的一個。在羅馬的門口，保守的政府統治下，窮人過著比兩千年前使異教詩人說出－人類種族只存在於少數人的利益－更為慘烈的道德貧血和身體衰弱的生活。"</p>
<p>The silence was breathless while the speaker made this personal
reference, and when he sat down, after a denunciation of the militarism
which was consuming the heart of the civilised world, the House was too
dazed to make any manifestation.</p><p>當演講者做出這種親身經歷的參考時，全場寂靜得令人窒息。當他在譴責正在吞噬文明世界心臟的軍國主義之後坐下來時，議會由於震驚而無法做出任何表示。</p>
<p>In the dead hush that followed, the President put the necessary
questions, but the amendment fell through without a vote being taken,
and the printed reply was passed.</p><p>在接下來的一片寂靜中，總統提出了必要的問題，但修訂案在未進行投票的情況下失敗，並透過了印刷的回覆。</p>
<p>Then the Minister of War rose to give notice of his bill for increased
military expenditure, and proposed to hand it over to the general
committee of the budget.</p><p>然後，戰爭部長站起來提出他的增加軍事支出的法案，並建議將其交給預算的一般委員會。</p>
<p>The Baron Bonelli rose next as Minister of the Interior, and gave notice
of his bill for the greater security of the public, and the remodelling
of the laws of the press and of association.</p><p>巴羅尼·博內利作為內政部長接著站起來，並提出了他的法案，以求更大的公共安全，並重新塑造新聞法和協會法。</p>
<p>He spoke incisively and bitterly, and he was obviously excited, but he
affected his usual composure.</p><p>他尖銳而尖酸地講話，顯然很興奮，但他仍然保持了他慣有的鎮定。</p>
<p>"After the language we have heard to-day," he said, "and the knowledge
we possess of mass meetings projected, it will not surprise the House
that I treat this measure as urgent, and propose that we consider it on
the principle of the three readings, taking the first of them in four
days."</p><p>"經過我們今天聽到的語言，"他說，"再加上我們對於計畫中的大規模會議的瞭解，我想議會不會對我將這項議案視為緊急並提議我們按照三次閱讀的原則來考慮它感到驚訝，並在四天後進行第一次閱讀。"</p>
<p>At that there were some cries from the Left, but the Minister continued:</p><p>"在那之後，左邊傳來一些喊聲，但部長繼續說："</p>
<p>"It will also not surprise the House that, to prevent the obstruction of
members who seem ready to sing their Miserere<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00186" title="142"><a id="Page_142" title="142"></a></span> without end, I will ask
the House to take the readings without debate."</p><p>"這也不會讓議會感到驚訝，為了防止那些似乎準備無休止地唱他們的懺悔詩的議員的阻攔，我將請求議會不經討論就進行閱讀。"</p>
<p>Then in a moment the whole House was in an uproar and members were
shaking their fists in each other's faces. In vain the President rang
his bell for silence. At length he put on his hat and left the Chamber,
and the sitting was at an end.</p><p>於是，霎時間，整個議會陷入騷動，成員們都對著對方的臉搖晃著他們的拳頭。主席白白地鳴鐘求靜，全都無效。最後他戴上帽子，離開了會議室，會議就此結束。</p>
<h3 id="pgepubid00187">IX</h3>
<p>The last post that night brought Rossi a letter from Roma.</p><p>那晚的最後一封郵件帶給羅西一封來自羅馬的信。</p>
<p style="padding-top:.5em;">"<span class="smcap">My dear, dear Friend</span>,—It's all up! I'm done with her! My unknown and
invisible sister that is to be, or rather isn't to be and oughtn't to
be, is not worth thinking about any longer. You tell me that she is good
and brave and noble-hearted, and yet you would have me believe that she
loves wealth, and ease, and luxury, and that she could not give them up
even for the sweetest thing that ever comes into a woman's life. Out on
her! What does she think a wife is? A pet to be pampered, a doll to be
dressed up and danced on your knee? If that's the sort of woman she is,
I know what I should call her. A name is on the tip of my tongue, and
the point of my finger, and the end of my pen, and I'm itching to have
it out, but I suppose I must not write it. Only don't talk to me any
more about the bravery of a woman like that.</p><p style="padding-top:.5em;">"親愛的朋友，一切都結束了！我與她劃清界限了！我的未見面且隱形的未來姐妹，或者應該說不再是也不應該再是姐妹，不再值得我去思考。你告訴我她善良、勇敢、有高尚的心，然而你卻想讓我相信她熱愛財富、富裕與華貴的生活，甚至不願為女人生活中最甜蜜的事物放棄。瞧她！她以為妻子是什麼？是個需要嬌寵的寵物，或是需要裝扮並在膝頭舞動的娃娃？如果她就是這種類型的女人，我已經知道該怎麼稱呼她了。一個名稱就在我舌尖、手指尖和筆尖，我渴望把它說出來，但我想我不應該寫下來。只是別再跟我說像那樣的女人有多勇敢。"</p>
<p>"The wife I call brave is a man's friend, and if she knows what that
means, to be the friend of her husband to all the limitless lengths of
friendship, she thinks nothing about sacrifices between him and her, and
differences of class do not exist for either of them. Her pride died the
instant love looked out of her eyes at him, and if people taunt her with
his poverty, or his birth, she answers and says: 'It's true he is poor,
but his glory is, that he was a workhouse boy who hadn't father or
mother to care for him, and now he is a great man, and I'm proud of him,
and not all the wealth of the world shall take me away.'</p><p>"我稱之為勇敢的妻子是男人的朋友，如果她知道這是什麼意思，即成為她丈夫的朋友到友誼的無盡之處，她對他和她之間的犧牲一點也不在意，他們兩人都沒有階級的差異。當她的眼睛看他時，她的驕傲在愛的瞬間消逝了，如果人們用他的貧窮來嘲笑她，或者他的出生，她會回答並說：'確實他是窮人，但他的光榮在於他曾是一個沒有父母關心他的救濟院的男孩，現在他是一個偉大的人，我為他感到驕傲，全世界的財富都不能帶走我。'</p>
<p>"One thing I will say, though, for the sister that isn't to be, and that
is, that you are deceiving yourself if you suppose that she is going to
reconcile herself to your separation while she is kept in the dark as to
the cause of it.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00188" title="143"><a id="Page_143" title="143"></a></span> It is all very well for you to pay compliments to her
beauty and youth and the natural strength of her mind to remove passing
impressions, but perhaps the impressions are the reverse of passing
ones, and if you go out of her life, what is to become of her? Have you
thought of that? Of course you haven't.</p><p>"我要說的一件事，儘管不適宜我這個身份，但我還是要說，如果你以為她在被矇在鼓裡的時候會對你們的分離感到安慰，那你就是自欺欺人。不論你怎麼誇讚她的美麗和青春，誇讚她的天生智慧能夠消除一時的感觸，但也許這些感觸並非暫時的，如果你離開了她的生活，那她該怎麼辦呢？你想過這個問題嗎？當然，你沒有。"</p>
<p>"No, no, no! My poor sister! you shall not be so hard on her! In my
darkness I could almost fancy that I personate her, and I am she and she
is I. Conceited, isn't it? But I told you it wasn't for nothing I was a
daughter of Eve. Anyhow I have fought hard for her and beaten you out
and out, and now I don't say: 'Will you go to her?' You will—I know you
will.</p><p>"不，不，不！我的可憐的妹妹！你不會對她這麼苛刻！在我的黑暗中，我幾乎可以想像我是她，我是她，她是我。自負，是吧？但是我告訴你，我不是無緣無故成為夏娃的女兒。無論如何，我為她努力戰鬥，並徹底打敗了你，現在我不說：'你會去找她嗎？'你會的——我知道你會的。"</p>
<p>"My bust is out of the caster's hand, and ought to be under mine, but
I've done no work again to-day. Tried, but the glow of soul was not
there, and I was injuring the face at every touch.</p><p>"我的胸像已脫離鑄造者的手，應該掌握在我手中，但是我今天又沒有工作。嘗試了，但靈魂的光輝並未在那裡，我每次觸摸都會傷害到臉部。"</p>
<p>"No further news of M——, and my heart's blood is cold at the silence.
But if you are fearless, why should I be afraid?—Your friend's
friend,</p><p>"關於M——的消息再也沒有，這種沉默使我心底的血涼了下來。但如果你勇無畏懼，我又何需害怕呢？—你朋友的朋友,"</p>

<p>Before going to bed that night, Rossi replied to Roma.</p><p>在那天晚上就寢前，羅西回覆了羅馬。</p>
<p style="padding-top:.5em;">"My Dearest,—Bruno will take this letter, and I will charge him on his
soul to deliver it safely into your hands. When you have read it, you
will destroy it immediately, both for your sake and my own.</p><p style="padding-top:.5em;">"我最親愛的，布魯諾將會帶這封信去，我會囑咐他他必須要把信安全的交到你手裡。當你讀完這封信後，你將立即銷毀它，為了你我的安全。"</p>
<p>"From this moment onward I throw away all disguises. The duplicities of
love are sweet and touching, but I cannot play hide-and-seek with you
any longer.</p><p>"從此刻起，我將拋棄所有的偽裝。愛的矛盾甜蜜且感人，但我不能再和你玩捉迷藏了。"</p>
<p>"You are right—it is you that I love, and little as I understand and
deserve it, I see now that you love me with all your soul and strength.
I cannot keep my pen from writing it, and yet it is madness to do so,
for the obstacles to our union are just as insurmountable as before.</p><p>"你是對的-我愛的是你，儘管我對此理解不深，也不值得，我現在看到你全心全意地愛我。我無法阻止我的筆去寫這些，但這又是瘋狂的行為，因為我們結合的障礙仍然像以前一樣不能克服。"</p>
<p>"It is not only my unflinching devotion to public work that separates
us, though that is a serious impediment; it is not only the inequality
of our birth and social conditions, though that is an honest difficulty.
The barrier between us<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00190" title="144"><a id="Page_144" title="144"></a></span> is not merely a barrier made by man, it is a
barrier made by God—it is death.</p><p>"不僅僅是我對公共工作的堅定奉獻使我們分開，雖然這是一項嚴重的障礙；不僅僅是我們出生和社會條件的不平等，雖然這是一個真正的困難。我們之間的障礙不僅僅是人類所製造的障礙，而是由神所製造的障礙-那就是死亡。"</p>
<p>"Think what that would be in the ordinary case of death by disease. A
man is doomed to die by cancer or consumption, and even while he is
engaged in a desperate struggle with the mightiest and most relentless
conqueror, love comes to him with its dreams of life and happiness. What
then? Every hour of joy is poisoned for him henceforth by visions of the
end that is so near, in every embrace he feels the arms of death about
him, and in every kiss the chill breath of the tomb.</p><p>"想想如果是普通病情致死的情況會如何。一個人註定要死於癌症或消耗症，即使他正在與最強大最冷酷的征服者進行激烈的抗爭，愛情也會帶著生活和幸福的夢想來到他身邊。然後呢？從此，他每一個快樂的時刻都被即將來臨的結局的畫面所毒害，在每一次擁抱中，他都感到死神的手臂在他身邊，在每一次吻中，他都感受到了墳墓的寒氣。"</p>
<p>"Terrible tragedy! Yet not without relief. Nature is kind. Her miracles
are never-ending. Hope lives to the last. The balm of God's healing hand
may come down from heaven and make all things well. Not so the death I
speak of. It is pitiless and inevitable, without hope or dreams.</p><p>"可怕的悲劇！然而並不是毫無寬慰。自然是仁慈的。她的奇蹟是永無止境的。希望一直存活到最後。來自天堂的神的治療之手的平安可能會降臨，讓一切恢復原狀。然而我所說的死亡並不如此。它是無情且不可避免的，沒有希望或夢想。"
</p>
<p>"Remember what I told you in this room on the night you came here first.
Had you forgotten it? Your father, charged with an attempt at regicide,
as part of a plan of insurrection, was deported without trial, and I,
who shared his views, and had expressed them in letters that were
violated, being outside the jurisdiction of the courts, was tried in
contumacy and condemned to death.</p><p>"請記住我在你第一次來到這個房間的那個晚上告訴你的話。你忘記了嗎?你的父親因企圖刺殺國王的罪名，在一場暴動的計劃中被無審判地驅逐出境，而我，擁有他的觀點，並且在被侵犯的信件中表達了，由於不在法院的管轄範圍內，我在缺席時被審判並被判處死刑。"</p>
<p>"I am back in Italy for all that, under another name, my mother's name,
which is my name too, thanks to the merciless marriage laws of my
country, with other aims and other opinions, but I have never deceived
myself for a moment. The same doom hangs over me still, and though the
court which condemned me was a military court, and its sentence would be
modified by a Court of Assize, I see no difference between death in a
moment on the gallows, and in five, ten, twenty years in a cell.</p><p>"我已經回到義大利，儘管使用了另一個名字，那是我母親的名字，也是我的名字，這要歸功於我國無情的婚姻法，雖然我的目標和觀點有所不同，但我從未欺騙過自己。同樣的厄運仍然揮之不去，儘管判決我的是一座軍事法庭，其判決會被一座大審法庭修改，但我看不出在絞刑架上瞬間死亡和在牢房裡五年、十年或二十年死亡有何不同。"</p>
<p>"What am I to do? I love you, you love me. Shall I, like the poor
consumptive, to whom gleams of happiness have come too late, conceal
everything and go on deluding myself with hopes, indulging myself with
dreams? It would be unpardonable, it would be cruel, it would be wrong
and wicked.</p><p>"我該怎麼辦？我愛你，你也愛我。我是否該如同那個窮困的結核病患者，對於難得的快樂閃光，是否該將一切掩藏起來，繼續以希望欺騙自己，以夢想安撫自己？這將是無法原諒的，這將是殘忍的，這將是錯誤的，這將是邪惡的。"</p>
<p>"No, it is impossible. You cannot but be aware that my life or liberty
is in serious jeopardy, and that my place in Parliament and in public
life is in constant and hourly peril. Every letter that you have written
to me shows plainly that you know it. And when you say your heart's<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00191" title="145"><a id="Page_145" title="145"></a></span>
blood runs cold at the thought of what may happen when Minghelli returns
from England, you betray the weakness, the natural weakness, the tender
and womanly weakness, which justifies me in saying that, as long as we
love each other, you and I should never meet again.</p><p>"不，這是不可能的。你不可能不知道我的生命或自由正處於嚴重的危險之中，我的議會和公共生活的地位每時每刻都在風險之中。你寫給我的每一封信都清楚地表明你知道這一點。而當你說你對明赫利從英國返回後可能會發生的事情感到心寒，你暴露出了弱點，天生的弱點，溫柔的女性弱點，這使我有理由說，只要我們還愛著對方，你和我就再也不應該見面了。"</p>
<p>"Don't think that I am a coward and tremble at the death that hangs over
me. I neither fear the future nor regret the past. In every true cause
some one is called to martyrdom. To die for the right, for humanity, to
lay down all you hold most dear for the sake of the poor and the weak
and the down-trodden and God's holy justice—it is a magnificent duty, a
privilege! And I am ready. If my death is enough, let me give the last
drop of my blood, and be dragged through the last degrees of infamy.
Only don't let me drag another after me, and endanger a life that is a
thousand times dearer to me than my own.</p><p>"不要以為我是一個膽小鬼，對懸在我頭上的死亡感到恐懼。我對未來無所畏懼，對過去無所遺憾。在每一個真正的事業中，總有人被召喚為烈士。為了正義，為了人類，為了窮人，為了無力的人，為了被壓迫的人，為了上帝的公正——這是一個偉大的責任，一個特權！我已經準備好了。如果我的死就足夠了，讓我獻出最後一滴血，讓我被拖過最後的羞辱。只是不要讓我帶著別人一起走，危害一個比我的生命重要千百倍的生命。"</p>
<p>"I want you, dearest, I want you with my soul, but my doom is certain;
it waits for me somewhere; it may be here, it may be there; <i>it may come
to me to-morrow</i>, or next day, or next year, but it is coming, I feel
it, I am sure of it, and I will not fly away. But if I go on until my
beloved is my bride, and my name is stamped all over her, and she has
taken up my fate, and we are one, and the world knows no difference,
what then? Then death with its sure step will come in to separate us,
and after death for me, danger, shame, poverty for you, all the
penalties a woman pays for her devotion to a man who is down and done.</p><p>"我渴望你，我親愛的，我用我的靈魂渴望你，但我的厄運是確定的;
無論在哪裡，它都在等待我;也許在這裡，也許在那裡;也許明天，也許後天，也許明年就會來到我身邊，但是我感到它正在來，我確定它正在來，我不會逃跑。但如果我堅持下去，直到我的摯愛成為我的新娘，我的名字已經銘刻在她的身上，並且她已經承擔了我的命運，我們成為一體，世界不再有任何區別，那麼會怎麼樣？那時，死亡將以其堅定的步伐走進我們的生活，將我們分開，而我死後，你將面臨危險，羞辱，貧困，等待你的是女性對於倒下的男人的奉獻所付出的所有代價。"</p>
<p>"I couldn't bear it. The very thought of it would unman me. It would
turn heaven into hell. It would disturb the repose of the grave itself.</p><p>"我無法忍受。單是想到這點就會讓我失去男子漢的氣概。它會將天堂變成地獄。它甚至會打擾墳墓中的安寧。"</p>
<p>"Isn't it hard enough to do what is before me without tormenting myself
with thoughts like these? It is true I have had my dreams like other
men—dreams of the woman whom Heaven might give a man for his
support—the anchor to which his soul might hold in storm and tempest,
and in the very hour of death itself. But what woman is equal to a lot
like that? Martyrdom is for man. God keep all women safe from it!</p><p>"我難道做當下的事情還不夠艱辛嗎，還要為這樣的想法折磨自己？沒錯，我也曾和其他男子一樣有過我的夢想——夢想著上天可能賜予一位男子的女子為他的支援，他的靈魂在風巡雨罰乃至臨終之際都可以依抓住這個女子。但是，有哪個女子能夠承受這樣的命運？殉道是男人的事。願上帝保佑所有女人遠離這種遭遇！"</p>
<p>"Have I said sufficient? If this letter gives you half the pain on

<p>As Ave Maria approached, David Rossi became still more agitated. The sky
had darkened, but there was no wind; the air was empty, and he listened
with strained attention for every sound from the staircase and the
street. At length he heard a cab stop at the door, and a moment
afterwards a light hurrying footstep in the outer room seemed to beat
upon his heart.</p><p>當《聖母瑪利亞之頌》鄰近時，David Rossi變得更加不安。天已經變暗，但風並沒有吹起；空氣裡一片空蕩，而他則緊張地聆聽來自樓梯和街道的每一個聲音。終於，他聽到一輛出租車在門前停下，緊接著外面房間裡輕快的腳步聲似乎直敲在他的心上。</p>
<p>The door opened and Roma came in quickly, with a scarcely audible
salutation. He saw her with her golden complexion and her large violet
eyes, wearing a black hat and an astrachan<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00194" title="147"><a id="Page_147" title="147"></a></span> coat, but his head was going
round and his pulses were beating violently, and he could not control
his eyes.</p><p>門打開了，羅馬迅速走了進來，幾乎聽不見的問候。他看到了她，她的金色膚色，她的大紫色眼睛，她戴著黑帽子，身穿阿斯特拉罕的大衣，但他的頭正在旋轉，他的脈搏正在劇烈跳動，他無法控制他的眼睛。</p>
<p>"I have come for a minute only," she said. "You received my letter?"</p><p>"我只來了一分鐘，"她說。"你收到我的信了嗎？"</p>
<p>Rossi bent his head.</p><p>"羅西低下了他的頭。"</p>
<p>"David, I want the fulfilment of your promise."</p><p>"大衛，我要你履行你的承諾。"</p>
<p>"What promise?"</p><p>"什麼承諾？"</p>
<p>"The promise to come to me when I stand in need of you. I need you now.
My fountain is practically finished, and to-morrow afternoon I am to
have a reception to exhibit it. Everybody will be there, and I want you
to be present also."</p><p>"當我需要你時，你答應會來到我身邊。我現在需要你。我的噴泉幾乎已經完成了，明天下午我將舉辦一場接待會來展示它。每個人都會來，我也希望你能出席。"</p>
<p>"Is that necessary?" he asked.</p><p>"那是必需的嗎？"他問。</p>
<p>"For my purposes, yes. Don't ask me why. Don't question me at all. Only
trust me and come."</p><p>"就我而言，是的。不要問我為什麼。根本不需要質疑我。只需要相信我並跟我來。"</p>
<p>She was speaking in a firm and rapid voice, and looking up he saw that
her brows were contracted, her lips were set, her cheeks were slightly
flushed, and her eyes were shining. He had never seen her like that
before. "What is the secret of it?" he asked himself, but he only
answered, after a brief pause:</p><p>她以堅定且迅速的語調講話，他抬頭望去，看到她的眉頭深鎖，嘴唇抿緊，臉頰微微發紅，眼睛閃爍著光芒。他從未見過她如此的模樣。他問自己，“這其中的秘密是什麼？”但他只在短暫的沈默之後回答：</p>
<p>"Very well, I will be there."</p><p>"好的，我會在那裡。"</p>
<p>"That's all. I might have written, but I was afraid you might object,
and I wished to make quite certain. Adieu!"</p><p>"就這樣了。我本可以寫下來，但我害怕你可能會反對，所以我想確定。再見!"</p>
<p>He had only bowed to her as she entered, and now she was going away
without offering her hand.</p><p>他只是向她鞠躬表示打招呼，現在她就要走了，但沒有伸出手來。</p>
<p>"Roma," he said, in a voice that sounded choked.</p><p>"羅馬，"他的聲音聽起來像是被噎住了。</p>
<p>She stopped but did not speak, and he felt himself growing hot all over.</p><p>她停下來，但並未說話，他感覺自己全身都變得炙熱。</p>
<p>"I'm relieved—so much relieved—to hear that you agree with what I said
in my letter."</p><p>"我很欣慰——非常欣慰——聽到你同意我在信中所說的話。"</p>
<p>"The last—in which you wish me to forget you?"</p><p>「你希望我忘記你的那個最後一次？」</p>
<p>"It is better so—far better. I am one of those who think that if either
party to a marriage"—he was talking in a constrained way—"entertains
beforehand any rational doubt about it, he is wiser to withdraw, even at
the church door, rather than set out on a life-long voyage under doubtful
auspices."</p><p>"這樣會更好，遠遠更好。我是那種人，認為如果婚姻中的任何一方"--他以一種受限的方式說話--"在此事之前有任何合理的疑慮，那麼他最好就算在教堂門口也要撤退，而不是在疑慮的預示下開始一生的航程。"</p>
<p>"Didn't we promise not to speak of this?" she said impatiently. Then
their eyes met for a moment, and he knew that he was false to himself
and that his talk of renunciation was a mockery.</p><p>"我們不是承諾不再談論這件事的嗎？"她不耐煩地說。然後，他們的目光相對了一會兒，他知道他對自己是不誠實的，他的放棄談話就是一種嘲諷。</p>
<p>"Roma," he said again, "if you want me in the future you must write."<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00195" title="148"><a id="Page_148" title="148"></a></span></p><p>"羅馬,"他再次說道，"如果你將來需要我，你必須寫信給我。"</p>
<p>Her face clouded over.</p><p>她的臉色變得陰沉。</p>
<p>"For your own sake, you know...."</p><p>為了你自己的利益，你知道的....</p>
<p>"Oh, that! That's nothing at all—nothing now."</p><p>"哦，那個！那可是什麼都不是—現在更是如此。"</p>
<p>"But people are insulting me about you, and...."</p><p>"但是有人因為你而侮辱我，和...."</p>
<p>"Well—and you?"</p><p>"那麼，你呢？"</p>
<p>The colour rushed to his cheeks and he smote the back of a chair with
his clenched fist.</p><p>他的臉色一下子就變紅了，他用緊握的拳頭擊打了椅子的背部。</p>
<p>"I tell them...."</p><p>"我告訴他們...."</p>
<p>"I understand," she said, and her eyes began to shine again. But she
only turned away, saying: "I'm sorry you are angry that I came."</p><p>"我明白了，"她說，她的眼睛又開始閃耀。但她只是轉身走開，說："對不起，你生我來這裡的氣。"</p>
<p>"Angry!" he cried, and at the sound of his voice as he said the word
their love for each other went thrilling through and through them.</p><p>"生氣！"他大喊，當他說出這個詞的時候，他們的聲音讓他們對彼此的愛情充滿了激動。</p>
<p>The rain had begun to fall, and it was beating with smart strokes on the
window panes.</p><p>雨已經開始下落，並且正在以巧妙的敲擊敲打窗戶的玻璃窗。</p>
<p>"You can't go now," he said, "and since you are never to come here again
there is something you ought to hear."</p><p>"你現在不能走，"他說，"既然你以後永遠不會再來這裡，有些話你應該聽一聽。"</p>
<p>She took a seat immediately, unfastened her coat, and slipped it back on
to her shoulders.</p><p>她立刻坐下，解開外套，並把它滑到她的肩膀上。</p>
<p>The thick-falling drops were drenching the piazza, and its pavement was
bubbling like a lake.</p><p>那密密麻麻的雨點釀濕了廣場，而它的地面就像湖面一樣冒出泡沫。</p>
<p>"The rain will last for some time," said Rossi, looking out, "and the
matter I speak of is one of some urgency, therefore it is better that
you should hear it now."</p><p>"會下一陣子的雨，"羅西看著窗外說，"我要說的事情有些緊急，所以你最好現在就聽。"</p>
<p>Taking the pins out of her hat, Roma lifted it off and laid it in her
lap, and began to pull off her gloves. The young head with its glossy
hair and lovely face shone out with a new beauty.</p><p>羅馬從她的帽子中取出別針，把它提起來放在她的膝蓋上，並開始脫下她的手套。那年輕的頭蓋，覆蓋著亮亮的頭髮和可愛的臉孔，以一種新的美麗閃耀出來。</p>
<p>Rossi hardly dared to look at her. He was afraid that if he allowed
himself to do so he would fling himself at her feet. "How calm she is,"
he thought. "What is the meaning of it?"</p><p>羅西幾乎不敢看她。他害怕如果他讓自己這麼做，他將會跪在她的腳下。他心想："她怎麼可以這麼冷靜？" "這是什麼意思？"</p>
<p>He went to the bureau by the wall and took out a small round packet.</p><p>他走到牆邊的櫃子，取出一個小小的圓形包裹。</p>
<p>"Do you remember your father's voice?" he asked.</p><p>"你記得你父親的聲音嗎？"他問。</p>
<p>"That is all I do remember about my father. Why?"</p><p>"那就是我對父親的所有記憶。為什麼呢?"</p>
<p>"It is here in this cylinder."</p><p>"它在這個氣缸裡面。"</p>
<p>She rose quickly and then slowly sat down again.</p><p>她迅速地起身，然後又慢慢坐了下來。</p>
<p>"Tell me," she said.</p><p>"告訴我,"她說。</p>
<p>"When your father was deported to the Island of Elba, he was a prisoner
at large, without personal restraint but under police supervision. The
legal term of <i>domicilio coatto</i><span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00196" title="149"><a id="Page_149" title="149"></a></span> is from one year to five, but excuses
were found and his banishment was made perpetual. He saw prisoners come
and go, and in the sealed chamber of his tomb he heard echoes of the
world outside."</p><p>"當你的父親被驅逐到埃爾巴島時，他是一個沒有個人限制但在警察監控下的大型囚犯。法律上的強制住宅期間從一年到五年不等，但找到了理由，他的流放變成了永久性的。他看到囚犯們來來去去，在他的密封墓室裡，他聽到了外面世界的回聲。"</p>
<p>"Did he ever hear of me?"</p><p>他有聽過我嗎？</p>
<p>"Yes, and of myself as well. A prisoner brought him news of one David
Rossi, and under that name and the opinions attached to it he recognised
David Leone, the boy he had brought up and educated. He wished to send
me a message."</p><p>"對，也包括我自己。一個囚犯給他帶來了一個名叫大衛·羅西的消息，他從那個名字和與其相關的觀點中認出了大衛·利歐內，這是他撫養和教育過的男孩。他希望給我一則消息。"</p>
<p>"Was it about...."</p><p>"那是關於...."</p>
<p>"Yes. The letters of prisoners are read and copied, and to smuggle out
by hand a written document is difficult or impossible. But at length a
way was discovered. Some one sent a phonograph and a box of cylinders to
one of the prisoners, and the little colony of exiled ones used to meet
at your father's house to hear the music. Among the cylinders were
certain blank ones. Your father spoke on to one of them, and when the
time came for the owner of the phonograph to leave Elba, he brought the
cylinder back with him. This is the cylinder your father spoke on to."</p><p>"是的。犯人的信件會被閱讀和複製，用手將書面文件偷運出去是困難的，甚至是不可能的。但最終，我們找到了一種方法。有人給其中一位囚犯寄送了一臺留聲機和一盒圓筒，這些被流放的小群體常在你父親的家中聚會以聆聽音樂。這些圓筒中有一些是空白的。你的父親在其中一個上面說話，當留聲機的主人離開厄爾巴島的時候，他帶走了這個你父親說話的圓筒。這就是你父親曾在上面講話的圓筒。"</p>
<p>With an involuntary shudder she took out of his hands a circular
cardboard-box, marked in print on the outside: "Selections from Faust,"
and in pencil on the inside of the lid: "For the hands of D. L. only—to
be destroyed if Deputy David Rossi does not know where to find him."</p><p>她不由自主地打了個寒顫，從他的手中接過了一個圓形的硬紙板盒子，外面的盒子上印著：“浮士德摘錄”，而盒子裡面的蓋子上則用鉛筆寫著：“僅供D. L. 手持——如果副手大衛·羅西不知道到哪裡找他的話，就將其銷燬。”</p>
<p>The heavy rain had darkened the room, but by the red light of a dying
fire he could see that her face had turned white.</p><p>大雨使房間變得昏暗，但他可以在即將熄滅的火光中看到她的臉色已經變得蒼白。</p>
<p>"And this contains my father's voice?" she said.</p><p>“這裡面包含我父親的聲音嗎？”</p>
<p>"His last message."</p><p>"他的最後一條訊息。"</p>
<p>"He is dead—two years dead—and yet...."</p><p>"他已經去世兩年了，但還是...."</p>
<p>"Can you bear to hear it?"</p><p>"你能忍受聽到它嗎？"</p>
<p>"Go on," she said, hardly audibly.</p><p>"繼續下去," 她幾乎聽不見地說。</p>
<p>He took back the cylinder, put it on the phonograph, wound up the
instrument, and touched the lever. Through the strokes of the rain,
lashing the window like a hundred whips, the whizzing noise of the
machine began.</p><p>他拿回那個圓筒，將其放在留聲機上，然後把機器上捲。在雨點劃過窗戶的聲音中，像一百條鞭子在抽打，留聲機的嗡嗡聲開始了。</p>
<p>He was standing by her side, and he felt her hand on his arm.</p><p>他站在她身旁，感受到她的手在他的手臂上。</p>
<p>Then through the sound of the rain and of the phonograph there came a
clear, full voice:</p><p>"然後，在雨聲和唱機的聲音中，傳來了一個清晰、飽滿的聲音："</p>

<p>The hand on Rossi's arm clutched it convulsively, and, in a choking
whisper, Roma said:</p><p>"Rossi的手臂上的手緊緊地握住它，而Roma用一種噎住的低語說道："</p>
<p>"Wait! Give me one moment."</p><p>"等一下！給我一點時間。"</p>
<p>She was looking around the darkening room as if almost expecting a
ghostly presence.</p><p>她凝視著變得越來越暗的房間，彷彿預期會有鬼魂出現。</p>
<p>She bowed her head. Her breath came quick and fast.</p><p>她低下了頭。她的呼吸急促而快速。</p>
<p>"I am better now. Go on," she said.</p><p>"我現在好多了。繼續吧，"她說。</p>
<p>The whirring noise began again, and after a moment the clear voice came

<p>"Little by little, in this grave of a living man, I have heard what has

<p>Rossi had stopped the phonograph.</p><p>"羅西停止了留聲機。"</p>
<p>"Can you bear it?" he said.</p><p>「你能忍受嗎？」他說。</p>
<p>The pale young face flushed with resolution.</p><p>那張蒼白的年輕臉龐因決心而變得煞白。</p>
<p>"Go on," she said.</p><p>"繼續，"她說。</p>
<p>When the voice from the phonograph began again it was more tremulous and
husky than before.</p><p>當唱片機的聲音再次響起時，比以前顫抖且沙啞更甚。</p>
<p>"After he had betrayed the father, what impulse of fear or humanity
prompted him to take charge of the child, God alone, who reads all
hearts, can say. He went to England to look for her, found her in the
streets to which she had been abandoned by the faithlessness of the
guardians to whom I left her, and shut their mouths by buying them to
the perjury of burying the unknown body of an unfortunate being in the
name of my beloved child."</p><p>"在他背叛了父親之後，是什麼樣的恐懼或人性驅使他去照顧那個孩子，只有讀懂所有心意的上帝才知道。他去英格蘭找她，發現她在街頭，她被我交給的那些守護者的背信忘義而被遺棄在那裡，他以購買他們以偽誓的方式來安葬一個不幸者未知的身體，在我心愛的孩子的名義上使他們閉嘴。"</p>
<p>The hand on Rossi's arm trembled feebly, and slipped down to his own
hand. It was cold as ice. The voice from the phonograph was growing
faint.<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00198" title="151"><a id="Page_151" title="151"></a></span></p><p>"羅西的手臂上的手微弱地顫抖，並滑下到他自己的手上。那手冷若冰霜。留聲機中的聲音正在變得微弱。"</p>
<p>"She is now in Rome, living in the name that was mine in Italy, amid an
atmosphere of danger and perhaps of shame. My son, save her from it. The
man who betrayed the father may betray the daughter also. Take her from
him. Rescue her. It is my dying prayer."</p><p>"她現在在羅馬，生活在我在義大利的名字中，周圍充滿危險，也許還帶有羞恥。我的兒子，從中拯救她。那個背叛了父親的人，也可能會背叛女兒。從他身邊帶走她。拯救她。這是在我臨終之際的祈禱。"</p>
<p>The hand in Rossi's hand was holding it tightly, and his blood was
throbbing at his heart.</p><p>羅西的手中緊緊握著另一隻手，他的心臟處疾病有力。</p>
<p>"David," the voice from the phonograph was failing rapidly, "when this
shall come to your hands the darkness of the grave will be over me....
In my great distress of mind I torture myself with many terrors.... Do
not trifle with my request. But whatever you decide to do ... be gentle
with the child.... I dream of her every night, and send my heart's heart
to her on the swelling tides of love.... Adieu, my son. The end is near.
God be with you in all you do that I did ill or left undone. And if
death's great sundering does not annihilate the memory of those who
remain on earth, be sure you have a helper and an advocate in heaven."</p><p>"大衛," 唱盤的聲音正在逐漸消逝，"當你拿到這個時，我可能已經去世了。在我心煩意亂的時候，我常常折磨自己，讓自己感到恐懼。請不要無視我的請求，無論你決定做什麼...請對小孩和善一些。我每晚都夢見她，並在澎湃的愛潮中向她表達我最深的愛...再見了，我的兒子。生命的最後關頭即將來臨。願上帝在你做我無法完成或沒有做的事情時與你同在。而且，如果死亡的大隔閡並不能讓地上的人忘掉那些在天堂的人，請一定要確信你在天堂有一個幫助者和辯護者。"</p>
<p>The voice ceased, the whirring of the instrument came to an end, and an
invisible spirit seemed to fade into the air. The pattering of the rain
had stopped, and there was the crackle of cab wheels on the pavement
below. Roma had dropped Rossi's hand, and was leaning forward on her
knees with both hands over her face. After a moment, she wiped her eyes
with her handkerchief and began to put on her hat.</p><p>那聲音停止了，那器樂的旋轉也結束，一種無形的精神似乎消散在空氣中。雨的拍打聲已經停止，下面的人行道上傳來了出租車輪子的劈啪聲。羅馬已經放開了羅西的手，並且用雙手遮住臉，向前傾斜在她的膝蓋上。過了一會兒，她用手帕擦了擦眼淚，然後開始戴起帽子。</p>
<p>"How long is it since you received this message?" she said.</p><p>"你收到這則消息有多久了？"她說。</p>
<p>"On the night you came here first."</p><p>"你第一次來到這裡的夜晚。"</p>
<p>"And when I asked you to come to my house on that ... that useless
errand, you were thinking of ... of my father's request as well?"</p><p>"那當我邀請你來我家處理那個......那個無用的任務，你是也在想著......想著我父親的要求嗎？"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p><p>"是的。"</p>
<p>"You have known all this about the Baron for a month, yet you have said
nothing. <i>Why</i> have you said nothing?"</p><p>"你已經知道男爵的所有事情一個月了，但你什麼都沒有說。你為什麼什麼都不說呢?"</p>
<p>"You wouldn't have believed me at first, whatever I had said against
him."</p><p>"一開始你不會相信我，無論我對他說了什麼貶低的話。"</p>
<p>"But afterwards?"</p><p>"但是之後呢？"</p>
<p>"Afterwards I had another reason."</p><p>"後來我有了另一個理由。"</p>
<p>"Did it concern me?"</p><p>"這關我什麼事？"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p><p>"是的。"</p>
<p>"And now?"</p><p>"現在呢？"</p>
<p>"Now that I have to part from you I am compelled to tell you what he
is."<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00199" title="152"><a id="Page_152" title="152"></a></span></p><p>"現在我必須與你分開，我被迫告訴你他是什麼。"</p>
<p>"But if you had known that all this time he has been trying to use
somebody against you...."</p><p>"但如果你知道這個人一直在嘗試利用某人對你不利......"</p>
<p>"That would have made no difference."</p><p>"那並不會有任何差別。"</p>
<p>She lifted her head, and a look of fire, almost of fierceness, came into
her face, but she only said, with a little hysterical cry, as if her
throat were swelling:</p><p>"她抬起了頭，臉上露出了幾乎狂野的火辣神情，但她只是發出一種小小的歇斯底里的哭聲，好像她的喉嚨在腫脹："</p>
<p>"Come to me to-morrow, David! Be sure you come! If you don't come I
shall never, never forgive you! But you will come! You will! You will!"</p><p>"明天來見我，大衛！一定要來！如果你不來，我永遠，永遠不會原諒你！但你會來的！你會！你會！"</p>
<p>And then, as if afraid of breaking out into sobs, she turned quickly and
hurried away.</p><p>然後，就像她害怕突然哭出來似的，她迅速轉身離開。</p>
<p>"She can never fall into that man's hands now," he thought. And then he
lit his lamp and sat down to his work, but the light was gone, and the
night had fallen on him.</p><p>"她現在永遠不會落入那個男人的手中了," 他心想。然後他點亮了他的燈，坐下來開始工作，但是光線消失了，夜晚已經降臨他身上了。</p>
<h3 id="pgepubid00200">XII</h3>
<p>Next morning David Rossi had not yet risen when some one knocked at his
door. It was Bruno. The great fellow looked nervous and troubled, and he
spoke in a husky whisper.</p><p>"隔天早晨，大衛·羅西還沒有起床，有人敲了他的門。那是布魯諾。這個魁偉的人看起來緊張且困擾，而他以沙啞的聲音低語。"</p>
<p>"You're not going to Donna Roma's to-day, sir?"</p><p>"您今天不去Donna Roma的地方嗎，先生？"</p>
<p>"Why not, Bruno?"</p><p>"為什麼不，布魯諾?"</p>
<p>"Have you seen her bust of yourself?"</p><p>"你有看到她的你的半身像嗎？"</p>
<p>"Hardly at all."</p><p>"幾乎不。"</p>
<p>"Just so. My case, too. She has taken care of that—locking it up every
night, and getting another caster to cast it. But I saw it the first
morning after she began, and I know what it is."</p><p>"正是如此。我的情況也是如此。她已經把這個情況處理好了 - 每晚都鎖上它，並找另一個魔法師來施放它。但我在她開始後的第一天早晨就看到了它，我知道那是什麼。"</p>
<p>"What is it, Bruno?"</p><p>“布魯諾，發生什麼事了？”</p>
<p>"You'll be angry again, sir."</p><p>"你又會生氣的，先生。"</p>
<p>"What is it?"</p><p>"這是什麼？"</p>
<p>"Judas—that's what it is, sir; the study for Judas in the fountain for
the Municipality."</p><p>"猶大-先生，那就是它; 在市政局的噴泉中為猶大進行的研究。"</p>
<p>"Is that all?"</p><p>"那就是全部嗎？"</p>
<p>"All?... But it's a caricature, a spiteful caricature! And you sat four
days and never even looked at it! I tell you it's disgusting, sir.
Simply disgusting. It's been done on purpose, too. When I think of it I
forget all you said, and I hate the woman as much as ever. And now she
is to have a reception, and you are going to it, just to help her to
have her laugh. Don't go, sir! Take the advice of a fool, and don't
go!"<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" id="pgepubid00201" title="153"><a id="Page_153" title="153"></a></span></p><p>"全部？... 但這只是個誇張的惡意模仿！而你坐了四天都沒有看一眼！我告訴你，這真是令人厭惡的，先生。簡直令人厭惡。這也是故意做的。想到這，我就忘記了你說的所有話，並且我仍然痛恨那個女人。現在她將要舉辦一個接待,而你要去參加,只是為了幫助她取樂。不要去，先生！接受一個愚人的建議，不要去！"</p>
<p>"Bruno," said Rossi, lying with his head on his arm, "understand me once
for all. Donna Roma may have used my head as a study for Judas—I cannot
deny that since you say it is so—but if she had used it as a study for
Satan, I would believe in her the same as ever."</p><p>"布魯諾，"羅西躺著，頭靠在手臂上，說道，"無論如何都要理解我。多納羅馬可能把我的頭當作研究猶大的對象—既然你說是這樣，我不能否認—但即使她把它用來研究撒旦，我對她的信任也始終如一。"</p>
<p>"You would?"</p><p>"你會嗎？"</p>
<p>"Yes, by God! So now, like a good fellow, go away and leave her alone."</p><p>"對，天啊！所以現在，像個好人一樣，離開並讓她一個人吧。"</p>
<p>The streets were more than usually full of people when Rossi set out for
the reception. Thick groups were standing about the hoardings, reading a
yellow placard, which was still wet with the paste of the bill-sticker.
It was a proclamation, signed by the Minister of the Interior, and it
ran:</p><p>"當羅西出門參加接待會時，街上的人比平時還要多。人們密密麻麻的圍在廣告牆前，看著一張還沾著貼上員濕漉漉的漿糊的黃色海報。那是一份由內政部長簽署的公告，內容是："</p>
<p style="font-style:italic"><span class="smcap">"Romans</span>,—It having come to the knowledge of the Government that a
set of misguided men, the enemies of the throne and of society, known to
be in league with the republican, atheist, and anarchist associations of
foreign countries, are inciting the people to resist the just laws made
by their duly elected Parliament, and sanctioned by their King, thus
trying to lead them into outbreaks that would be unworthy of a
cultivated and generous race, and would disgrace us in the view of other
nations—the Government hereby give notice that they will not allow
the laws to be insulted with impunity, and therefore they warn the
public against the holding of all such mass meetings in public
buildings, squares, and streets, as may lead to the possibility of
serious disturbances."</p><p style="font-style:italic">"羅馬人，政府已經得知一些被誤導的人，這些人是王位與社會的敵人，他們已知與外國的共和，無神論和無政府主義團體有聯絡，並正在煽動人民反抗由他們的民選議會所制定，並且由他們的國王認可的公正法律，因此試圖引導他們成為不配稱職的暴動群眾，這將使我們在其他國家面前失去榮譽。因此，政府在此告知他們將不允許法律被藐視，並且他們警告公眾，反對在公共建築物，廣場和街道等可能引起嚴重干擾的地方舉行公眾集會。"
